       "'\\nRobert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not\\nthink that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it\\nmeant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked\\nit, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling\\nof inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at\\nPrinceton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock\\ndown anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a\\nthoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider\\nKelly\\'s star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box\\nlike featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five\\nor two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really\\nvery fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got\\nhis nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn\\'s distaste for\\nboxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and\\nit certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read\\ntoo much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his\\nclass who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was\\nmiddleweight boxing champion.\\n \\nI mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories\\nhold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had\\nnever been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had\\nstepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or\\nseen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young\\nchild, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.\\nSpider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had\\nbecome of him.\\n \\nRobert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest\\nJewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the\\noldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and\\nplayed a very good end on the football team, no one had made him\\nrace-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence\\nany different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a\\nnice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took\\nit out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful\\nself-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first\\ngirl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children,\\nlost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance\\nof the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather\\nunattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just\\nwhen he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off\\nwith a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about\\nleaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to\\ndeprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.\\n \\nThe divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In\\nCalifornia he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little\\nof the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of\\nthe Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and\\nfinished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been\\nregarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the\\neditorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the\\nsole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority\\nof editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he\\nhad to give it up.\\n \\nBy that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been\\ntaken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was\\nvery forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand.\\nAlso he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine\\nwas not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and\\ndecided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was\\nstill something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where\\nCohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated,\\nand stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in\\ntravel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks\\nand myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.\\n \\nThe lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the\\nsecond year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert\\nchanged from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute\\ndetermination that he should marry her. During this time Robert\\'s mother\\nhad settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.\\nDuring two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at\\nanother woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living\\nin Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered\\nwriting. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the\\ncritics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many\\nbooks, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.\\n \\nI first became aware of his lady\\'s attitude toward him one night after\\nthe three of us had dined together. We had dined at l\\'Avenue\\'s and\\nafterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several\\n  after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been\\ntalking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He\\nwanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to\\nStrasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.\\n\"I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,\" I said.\\n \\nSomebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went\\non: \"She\\'s been there two years and knows everything there is to know\\nabout the town. She\\'s a swell girl.\"\\n \\nI was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert\\'s\\nlady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.\\n \\n\"Hell,\" I said, \"why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to\\nthe Ardennes.\"\\n \\nCohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went\\nout. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner\\nwith me. \"For God\\'s sake,\" he said, \"why did you say that about that\\ngirl in Strasbourg for? Didn\\'t you see Frances?\"\\n \\n\"No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg\\nwhat the hell is it to Frances?\"\\n \\n\"It doesn\\'t make any difference. Any girl. I couldn\\'t go, that would be\\nall.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be silly.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn\\'t you see the way she\\nlooked?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, well,\" I said, \"let\\'s go to Senlis.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t get sore.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf\\nand take a hike in the woods and come home.\"\\n \\n\"Good, that will be fine.\"\\n \\n\"Well, I\\'ll see you to-morrow at the courts,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Good-night, Jake,\" he said, and started back to the café.\\n \\n\"You forgot to get your paper,\" I said.\\n \\n\"That\\'s so.\" He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. \"You are\\nnot sore, are you, Jake?\" He turned with the paper in his hand.\\n \\n\"No, why should I be?\"\\n \\n\"See you at tennis,\" he said. I watched him walk back to the café\\nholding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a\\nlife.\\n \\nThat winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was\\naccepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I\\nheard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several\\nwomen were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite\\nchanged. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was\\nnot so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his\\nnovel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women\\nhad put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all\\nshifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his\\nwife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond\\nFrances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.\\n \\nHe had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college,\\nand Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not\\nbeen everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he\\nrealized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact\\nof a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a\\ndivine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have\\naround. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some\\nrather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held\\ncards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his\\nbridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make\\na living at bridge if he were ever forced to.\\n \\nThen there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That\\nsounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread \"The\\nPurple Land.\" \"The Purple Land\" is a very sinister book if read too late\\nin life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect\\nEnglish gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is\\nvery well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book\\nto what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same\\nage to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a\\ncomplete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took\\nevery word of \"The Purple Land\" as literally as though it had been an\\nR. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on\\nthe whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set\\nhim off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until\\none day he came into my office.\\n \\n\"Hello, Robert,\" I said. \"Did you come in to cheer me up?\"\\n \\n\"Would you like to go to South America, Jake?\" he asked.\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Why not?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the\\nSouth Americans you want in Paris anyway.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re not the real South Americans.\"\\n \\n\"They look awfully real to me.\"\\n \\nI had a boat train to catch with a week\\'s mail stories, and only half of\\nthem written.\\n \\n\"Do you know any dirt?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"None of your exalted connections getting divorces?\"\\n \\n\"No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South\\nAmerica with me?\"\\n \\n\"Why me?\"\\n \\n\"You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said, \"I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time.\"\\n \\n\"All my life I\\'ve wanted to go on a trip like that,\" Cohn said. He sat\\ndown. \"I\\'ll be too old before I can ever do it.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" I said. \"You can go anywhere you want. You\\'ve got\\nplenty of money.\"\\n \\n\"I know. But I can\\'t get started.\"\\n \\n\"Cheer up,\" I said. \"All countries look just like the moving pictures.\"\\n \\nBut I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.\\n \\n\"I can\\'t stand it to think my life is going so fast and I\\'m not really\\nliving it.\"\\n \\n\"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not interested in bull-fighters. That\\'s an abnormal life. I want to\\ngo back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip.\"\\n \\n\"Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?\"\\n \\n\"No, I wouldn\\'t like that.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'d go there with you.\"\\n \\n\"No; that doesn\\'t interest me.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book\\nall full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.\"\\n \\n\"I want to go to South America.\"\\n \\nHe had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.\\n \\n\"Come on down-stairs and have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t you working?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I\\nhad discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had\\na drink all you had to say was: \"Well, I\\'ve got to get back and get off\\nsome cables,\" and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful\\nexits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important\\npart of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we\\nwent down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at\\nthe bottles in bins around the wall. \"This is a good place,\" he said.\\n \\n\"There\\'s a lot of liquor,\" I agreed.\\n \\n\"Listen, Jake,\" he leaned forward on the bar. \"Don\\'t you ever get the\\nfeeling that all your life is going by and you\\'re not taking advantage\\nof it? Do you realize you\\'ve lived nearly half the time you have to live\\nalready?\"\\n \\n\"Yes, every once in a while.\"\\n \\n\"Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we\\'ll be dead?\"\\n \\n\"What the hell, Robert,\" I said. \"What the hell.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m serious.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s one thing I don\\'t worry about,\" I said.\\n \\n\"You ought to.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve had plenty to worry about one time or other. I\\'m through\\nworrying.\"\\n \\n\"Well, I want to go to South America.\"\\n \\n\"Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn\\'t make any difference.\\nI\\'ve tried all that. You can\\'t get away from yourself by moving from one\\nplace to another. There\\'s nothing to that.\"\\n \\n\"But you\\'ve never been to South America.\"\\n \\n\"South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be\\nexactly the same. This is a good town. Why don\\'t you start living your\\nlife in Paris?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m sick of Paris, and I\\'m sick of the Quarter.\"\\n \\n\"Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what\\nhappens to you.\"\\n \\n\"Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing\\nhappened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.\"\\n \\n\"Wasn\\'t the town nice at night?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t care for Paris.\"\\n \\nSo there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could\\ndo anything about, because right away you ran up against the two\\nstubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He\\ngot the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a\\nbook too.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I\\'ve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.\"\\n \\n\"Do you really have to go?\"\\n \\n\"Yes, I\\'ve got to get these cables off.\"\\n \\n\"Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?\"\\n \\n\"No, come on up.\"\\n \\nHe sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and\\nPublisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the\\ncarbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila\\nenvelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went\\nout into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big\\nchair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake\\nhim up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on\\nhis shoulder. He shook his head. \"I can\\'t do it,\" he said, and put his\\nhead deeper into his arms. \"I can\\'t do it. Nothing will make me do it.\"\\n \\n\"Robert,\" I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled\\nand blinked.\\n \\n\"Did I talk out loud just then?\"\\n \\n\"Something. But it wasn\\'t clear.\"\\n \\n\"God, what a rotten dream!\"\\n \\n\"Did the typewriter put you to sleep?\"\\n \\n\"Guess so. I didn\\'t sleep all last night.\"\\n \\n\"What was the matter?\"\\n \\n\"Talking,\" he said.\\n \\nI could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom\\nscenes of my friends. We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an\\n  and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.\\n \\nIt was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the\\nNapolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric\\nsigns come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the\\ncrowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge\\nof the solid taxi traffic, and the   going by, singly and in\\npairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk\\npast the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her,\\nand watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She\\nwent by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down\\nat the table. The waiter came up.\\n \\n\"Well, what will you drink?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Pernod.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s not good for little girls.\"\\n \\n\"Little girl yourself. Dites garçon, un pernod.\"\\n \\n\"A pernod for me, too.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" she asked. \"Going on a party?\"\\n \\n\"Sure. Aren\\'t you?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. You never know in this town.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you like Paris?\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Why don\\'t you go somewhere else?\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t anywhere else.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re happy, all right.\"\\n \\n\"Happy, hell!\"\\n \\nPernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns\\nmilky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops\\nyou just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"are you going to buy me a dinner?\"\\n \\nShe grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her\\nmouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we\\nwalked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up\\nat the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling   we\\nmoved up the Avenue de l\\'Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops,\\ntheir windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.\\nThe cab passed the New York   bureau with the window full of\\nclocks.\\n \\n\"What are all the clocks for?\" she asked.\\n \\n\"They show the hour all over America.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t kid me.\"\\n \\nWe turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic\\nof the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She\\ncuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be\\nkissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.\\n \\n\"Never mind.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter? You sick?\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"Everybody\\'s sick. I\\'m sick, too.\"\\n \\nWe came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and\\nthen turned up the Rue des Saints Pères.\\n \\n\"You oughtn\\'t to drink pernod if you\\'re sick.\"\\n \\n\"You neither.\"\\n \\n\"It doesn\\'t make any difference with me. It doesn\\'t make any difference\\nwith a woman.\"\\n \\n\"What are you called?\"\\n \\n\"Georgette. How are you called?\"\\n \\n\"Jacob.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s a Flemish name.\"\\n \\n\"American too.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re not Flamand?\"\\n \\n\"No, American.\"\\n \\n\"Good, I detest Flamands.\"\\n \\nBy this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the   to\\nstop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.\\n\"This is no great thing of a restaurant.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"Maybe you would rather go to Foyot\\'s. Why don\\'t you keep\\nthe cab and go on?\"\\n \\nI had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be\\nnice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a\\n , and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the\\nrestaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room.\\nGeorgette cheered up a little under the food.\\n \\n\"It isn\\'t bad here,\" she said. \"It isn\\'t chic, but the food is all\\nright.\"\\n \\n\"Better than you eat in Liège.\"\\n \\n\"Brussels, you mean.\"\\n \\nWe had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and\\nshowed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. \"You\\'re not a bad\\ntype,\" she said. \"It\\'s a shame you\\'re sick. We get on well. What\\'s the\\nmatter with you, anyway?\"\\n \\n\"I got hurt in the war,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Oh, that dirty war.\"\\n \\nWe would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it\\nwas in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been\\nbetter avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some\\none called: \"Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a friend calling me,\" I explained, and went out.\\n \\nThere was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne,\\nMrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.\\n \\n\"You\\'re coming to the dance, aren\\'t you?\" Braddocks asked.\\n \\n\"What dance?\"\\n \\n\"Why, the dancings. Don\\'t you know we\\'ve revived them?\" Mrs. Braddocks\\nput in.\\n \\n\"You must come, Jake. We\\'re all going,\" Frances said from the end of the\\ntable. She was tall and had a smile.\\n \\n\"Of course, he\\'s coming,\" Braddocks said. \"Come in and have coffee with\\nus, Barnes.\"\\n \\n\"Right.\"\\n \\n\"And bring your friend,\" said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a\\nCanadian and had all their easy social graces.\\n \\n\"Thanks, we\\'ll be in,\" I said. I went back to the small room.\\n \\n\"Who are your friends?\" Georgette asked.\\n \\n\"Writers and artists.\"\\n \\n\"There are lots of those on this side of the river.\"\\n \\n\"Too many.\"\\n \\n\"I think so. Still, some of them make money.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n \\nWe finished the meal and the wine. \"Come on,\" I said. \"We\\'re going to\\nhave coffee with the others.\"\\n \\nGeorgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in\\nthe little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and\\nstraightened her hat.\\n \\n\"Good,\" she said.\\n \\nWe went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his\\ntable stood up.\\n \\n\"I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,\" I said.\\nGeorgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.\\n \\n\"Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?\" Mrs. Braddocks\\nasked.\\n \\n\"Connais pas,\" Georgette answered.\\n \\n\"But you have the same name,\" Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.\\n \\n\"No,\" said Georgette. \"Not at all. My name is Hobin.\"\\n \\n\"But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely\\nhe did,\" insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking\\nFrench was liable to have no idea what she was saying.\\n \\n\"He\\'s a fool,\" Georgette said.\\n \\n\"Oh, it was a joke, then,\" Mrs. Braddocks said.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" said Georgette. \"To laugh at.\"\\n \\n\"Did you hear that, Henry?\" Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to\\nBraddocks. \"Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc,\\nand her name is actually Hobin.\"\\n \\n\"Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I\\'ve known her for a very long\\ntime.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,\" Frances Clyne called, speaking French very\\nrapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its\\ncoming out really French. \"Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it\\nhere? You love Paris, do you not?\"\\n \\n\"Who\\'s she?\" Georgette turned to me. \"Do I have to talk to her?\"\\n \\nShe turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head\\npoised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.\\n \\n\"No, I don\\'t like Paris. It\\'s expensive and dirty.\"\\n \\n\"Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities\\nin all Europe.\"\\n \\n\"I find it dirty.\"\\n \\n\"How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve been here long enough.\"\\n \\n\"But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.\"\\n \\nGeorgette turned to me. \"You have nice friends.\"\\n \\nFrances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but\\nthe coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all\\nwent out and started for Braddocks\\'s dancing-club.\\n \\nThe dancing-club was a   in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte\\nGeneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter\\ndanced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights\\nit was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a\\npoliceman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the\\nzinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came\\ndownstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across\\nthe room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.\\n \\n\"I wish people would come earlier,\" Braddocks said. The daughter came up\\nand wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high\\nstool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a\\nstring of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as\\nhe played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor\\nperspiring.\\n \\n\"My God,\" Georgette said. \"What a box to sweat in!\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s hot.\"\\n \\n\"Hot, my God!\"\\n \\n\"Take off your hat.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s a good idea.\"\\n \\nSome one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was\\nreally very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I\\ndrank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of\\nwind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They\\nboth stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys\\nand some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and\\nnewly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman\\nstanding by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went\\nin, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces,\\ngrimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very\\nlovely and she was very much with them.\\n \\nOne of them saw Georgette and said: \"I do declare. There is an actual\\nharlot. I\\'m going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me.\"\\n \\nThe tall dark one, called Lett, said: \"Don\\'t you be rash.\"\\n \\nThe wavy blond one answered: \"Don\\'t you worry, dear.\" And with them was\\nBrett.\\n \\nI was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are\\nsupposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to\\nswing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering\\ncomposure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar\\nat the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take\\nthe taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd\\non the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who\\ndanced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he\\ndanced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to\\ndance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all\\ndance with her. They are like that.\\n \\nI sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs.\\nBraddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He\\nwas from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He\\nhad some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.\\n \\n\"Thanks so much,\" he said, \"I\\'ve just had one.\"\\n \\n\"Have another.\"\\n \\n\"Thanks, I will then.\"\\n \\nWe got the daughter of the house over and each had a  .\\n \\n\"You\\'re from Kansas City, they tell me,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"Do you find Paris amusing?\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"Really?\"\\n \\nI was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to\\nbe careless.\\n \\n\"For God\\'s sake,\" I said, \"yes. Don\\'t you?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, how charmingly you get angry,\" he said. \"I wish I had that\\nfaculty.\"\\n \\nI got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks\\nfollowed me. \"Don\\'t be cross with Robert,\" she said. \"He\\'s still only a\\nchild, you know.\"\\n \\n\"I wasn\\'t cross,\" I said. \"I just thought perhaps I was going to throw\\nup.\"\\n \\n\"Your fiancée is having a great success,\" Mrs. Braddocks looked out on\\nthe floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one,\\ncalled Lett.\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t she?\" I said.\\n \\n\"Rather,\" said Mrs. Braddocks.\\n \\nCohn came up. \"Come on, Jake,\" he said, \"have a drink.\" We walked over\\nto the bar. \"What\\'s the matter with you? You seem all worked up over\\nsomething?\"\\n \\n\"Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all.\"\\n \\nBrett came up to the bar.\\n \\n\"Hello, you chaps.\"\\n \\n\"Hello, Brett,\" I said. \"Why aren\\'t you tight?\"\\n \\n\"Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and\\nsoda.\"\\n \\nShe stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He\\nlooked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the\\npromised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look\\nof eager, deserving expectation.\\n \\nBrett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a\\ntweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy\\'s. She started all\\nthat. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you\\nmissed none of it with that wool jersey.\\n \\n\"It\\'s a fine crowd you\\'re with, Brett,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?\"\\n \\n\"At the Napolitain.\"\\n \\n\"And have you had a lovely evening?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, priceless,\" I said.\\n \\nBrett laughed. \"It\\'s wrong of you, Jake. It\\'s an insult to all of us.\\nLook at Frances there, and Jo.\"\\n \\nThis for Cohn\\'s benefit.\\n \\n\"It\\'s in restraint of trade,\" Brett said. She laughed again.\\n \\n\"You\\'re wonderfully sober,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Yes. Aren\\'t I? And when one\\'s with the crowd I\\'m with, one can drink in\\nsuch safety, too.\"\\n \\nThe music started and Robert Cohn said: \"Will you dance this with me,\\nLady Brett?\"\\n \\nBrett smiled at him. \"I\\'ve promised to dance this with Jacob,\" she\\nlaughed. \"You\\'ve a hell of a biblical name, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"How about the next?\" asked Cohn.\\n \\n\"We\\'re going,\" Brett said. \"We\\'ve a date up at Montmartre.\" Dancing, I\\nlooked over Brett\\'s shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still\\nwatching her.\\n \\n\"You\\'ve made a new one there,\" I said to her.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, well,\" I said. \"I suppose you like to add them up.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t talk like a fool.\"\\n \\n\"You do.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, well. What if I do?\"\\n \\n\"Nothing,\" I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was\\nplaying the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to\\nGeorgette dancing with another one of them.\\n \\n\"What possessed you to bring her?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know, I just brought her.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re getting damned romantic.\"\\n \\n\"No, bored.\"\\n \\n\"Now?\"\\n \\n\"No, not now.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s get out of here. She\\'s well taken care of.\"\\n \\n\"Do you want to?\"\\n \\n\"Would I ask you if I didn\\'t want to?\"\\n \\nWe left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it\\non. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the\\nbar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a\\nfifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and\\nhanded it to the patronne.\\n \\n\"If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?\" I said.\\n\"If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for\\nme?\"\\n \\n\"C\\'est entendu, Monsieur,\" the patronne said. \"You go now? So early?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said.\\n \\nWe started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good\\nnight and took my arm. \"Good night, Cohn,\" I said. Outside in the street\\nwe looked for a taxi.\\n \\n\"You\\'re going to lose your fifty francs,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n \\n\"No taxis.\"\\n \\n\"We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.\"\\n \\n\"Come on and we\\'ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.\"\\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t walk across the street.\"\\n \\n\"Not if I could help it.\"\\n \\nWe went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"we\\'re out away from them.\"\\n \\nWe stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each\\nother. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my\\nhand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. \"Where should I\\ntell him?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Oh, tell him to drive around.\"\\n \\nI told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed\\nthe door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got\\nin and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.\\n \\n\"Oh, darling, I\\'ve been so miserable,\" Brett said.\\n \\nThe taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the\\ndark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St.\\nEtienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and\\nthe standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the\\ncobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open\\nshops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted\\nclose together going down the old street. Brett\\'s hat was off. Her head\\nwas back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was\\ndark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des\\nGobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks\\nby the light of acetylene flares. Brett\\'s face was white and the long\\nline of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street\\nwas dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then\\nshe turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away\\nas she could get. Her head was down.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t touch me,\" she said. \"Please don\\'t touch me.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t stand it.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, Brett.\"\\n \\n\"You mustn\\'t. You must know. I can\\'t stand it, that\\'s all. Oh, darling,\\nplease understand!\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you love me?\"\\n \\n\"Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t there anything we can do about it?\"\\n \\nShe was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back\\nagainst me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with\\nthat way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw\\nout of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else\\'s\\neyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there\\nwere nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she\\nwas afraid of so many things.\\n \\n\"And there\\'s not a damn thing we could do,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"I don\\'t want to go through that hell again.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'d better keep away from each other.\"\\n \\n\"But, darling, I have to see you. It isn\\'t all that you know.\"\\n \\n\"No, but it always gets to be.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s my fault. Don\\'t we pay for all the things we do, though?\"\\n \\nShe had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different\\ndepths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the\\nway into them.\\n \\n\"When I think of the hell I\\'ve put chaps through. I\\'m paying for it all\\nnow.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t talk like a fool,\" I said. \"Besides, what happened to me is\\nsupposed to be funny. I never think about it.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, no. I\\'ll lay you don\\'t.\"\\n \\n\"Well, let\\'s shut up about it.\"\\n \\n\"I laughed about it too, myself, once.\" She wasn\\'t looking at me. \"A\\nfriend of my brother\\'s came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a\\nhell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"Nobody ever knows anything.\"\\n \\nI was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had\\nprobably considered it from most of its various angles, including the\\none that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment\\nwhile remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.\\n \\n\"It\\'s funny,\" I said. \"It\\'s very funny. And it\\'s a lot of fun, too, to\\nbe in love.\"\\n \\n\"Do you think so?\" her eyes looked flat again.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t mean fun that way. In a way it\\'s an enjoyable feeling.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" she said. \"I think it\\'s hell on earth.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s good to see each other.\"\\n \\n\"No. I don\\'t think it is.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you want to?\"\\n \\n\"I have to.\"\\n \\nWe were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc\\nMontsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and\\nwhere you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The\\ndriver leaned his head around.\\n \\n\"Where do you want to go?\" I asked. Brett turned her head away.\\n \\n\"Oh, go to the Select.\"\\n \\n\"Café Select,\" I told the driver. \"Boulevard Montparnasse.\" We drove\\nstraight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the\\npassing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard\\nRaspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: \"Would\\nyou mind very much if I asked you to do something?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be silly.\"\\n \\n\"Kiss me just once more before we get there.\"\\n \\nWhen the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her\\nhat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. \"I\\nsay, do I look too much of a mess?\" She pulled her man\\'s felt hat down\\nand started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were\\nmost of the crowd who a been at the dance.\\n \\n\"Hello, you chaps,\" Brett said. \"I\\'m going to have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, Brett! Brett!\" the little Greek portrait-painter, who called\\nhimself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. \"I got\\nsomething fine to tell you.\"\\n \\n\"Hello, Zizi,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I want you to meet a friend,\" Zizi said. A fat man came up.\\n \\n\"Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.\"\\n \\n\"How do you do?\" said Brett.\\n \\n\"Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?\" asked Count\\nMippipopolous, who wore an elk\\'s tooth on his watch-chain.\\n \\n\"Rather,\" said Brett.\\n \\n\"Paris is a fine town all right,\" said the count. \"But I guess you have\\npretty big doings yourself over in London.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Brett. \"Enormous.\"\\n \\nBraddocks called to me from a table. \"Barnes,\" he said, \"have a drink.\\nThat girl of yours got in a frightful row.\"\\n \\n\"What about?\"\\n \\n\"Something the patronne\\'s daughter said. A corking row. She was rather\\nsplendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne\\'s\\ndaughter\\'s too. I say it was a row.\"\\n \\n\"What finally happened?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command\\nof the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"I must shove off. Seen Cohn?\"\\n \\n\"He went home with Frances,\" Mrs. Braddock put in.\\n \\n\"Poor chap, he looks awfully down,\" Braddocks said.\\n \\n\"I dare say he is,\" said Mrs. Braddocks.\\n \\n\"I have to shove off,\" I said. \"Good night.\"\\n \\nI said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne.\\n\"Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?\" he asked.\\n \\n\"No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.\"\\n \\n\"Really going?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I\\'ve got a rotten headache.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll see you to-morrow?\"\\n \\n\"Come in at the office.\"\\n \\n\"Hardly.\"\\n \\n\"Well, where will I see you?\"\\n \\n\"Anywhere around five o\\'clock.\"\\n \\n\"Make it the other side of town then.\"\\n \\n\"Good. I\\'ll be at the Crillon at five.\"\\n \\n\"Try and be there,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" Brett said. \"I\\'ve never let you down, have I?\"\\n \\n\"Heard from Mike?\"\\n \\n\"Letter to-day.\"\\n \\n\"Good night, sir,\" said the count.\\n \\nI went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St.\\nMichel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across\\nthe street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the\\npavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was\\nand went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was\\ndeserted. Lavigne\\'s was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables\\noutside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney\\'s statue standing among the\\nnew-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple\\nwreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription:\\nfrom the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine,\\nMarshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green\\nnew horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little\\nway down the Boulevard St. Michel.\\n \\nThere was a light in the concierge\\'s room and I knocked on the door and\\nshe gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There\\nwere two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light\\nin the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank\\nstatement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and\\ndeducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered\\nI had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement.\\nThe other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby\\nannounce the marriage of their daughter Katherine--I knew neither the\\ngirl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town.\\nIt was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name\\nlike Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the\\nannouncement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was\\nfunny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell\\nwith you, Lady Ashley.\\n \\nI lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide\\nwindows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the\\nwindows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on\\nthe street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They\\nwere noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at\\nmyself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a\\ntypically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of\\nall the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas\\nand got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their\\nwrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the\\nsame news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other.  \\nwas the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way\\nthrough, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew\\nout the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.\\n \\nMy head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to\\nbe wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian\\nhospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in\\nItalian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in\\nthe Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was\\nthe Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was\\nZonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was\\nfunny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But\\nthey had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: \"You, a\\nforeigner, an Englishman\" (any foreigner was an Englishman) \"have given\\nmore than your life.\" What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated\\nto hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my\\nplace, I guess. \"Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!\"\\n \\nI never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just\\nnot make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble\\nif I hadn\\'t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose\\nshe only wanted what she couldn\\'t have. Well, people were that way. To\\nhell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of\\nhandling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it\\nwas swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.\\n \\nI lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn\\'t keep\\naway from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it\\nwent away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around\\nand started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I\\nstarted to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and\\nlistened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I\\nwent to sleep.\\n \\nI woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I\\nrecognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The\\nconcierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name\\nand called down the stairs.\\n \\n\"Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?\" the concierge called.\\n \\n\"Yes. It\\'s me.\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s a species of woman here who\\'s waked the whole street up. What\\nkind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see\\nyou. I\\'ve told her you\\'re asleep.\"\\n \\nThen I heard Brett\\'s voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was\\nGeorgette. I don\\'t know why. She could not have known my address.\\n \\n\"Will you send her up, please?\"\\n \\nBrett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. \"Silly thing to\\ndo,\" she said. \"Make an awful row. I say, you weren\\'t asleep, were you?\"\\n \\n\"What did you think I was doing?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t know. What time is it?\"\\n \\nI looked at the clock. It was half-past four. \"Had no idea what hour it\\nwas,\" Brett said. \"I say, can a chap sit down? Don\\'t be cross, darling.\\nJust left the count. He brought me here.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s he like?\" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.\\n \\n\"Just a little,\" said Brett. \"Don\\'t try and make me drunk. The count?\\nOh, rather. He\\'s quite one of us.\"\\n \\n\"Is he a count?\"\\n \\n\"Here\\'s how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows\\nhell\\'s own amount about people. Don\\'t know where he got it all. Owns a\\nchain of sweetshops in the States.\"\\n \\nShe sipped at her glass.\\n \\n\"Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up.\\nTold me a little about it. Damned interesting. He\\'s one of us, though.\\nOh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell.\"\\n \\nShe took another drink.\\n \\n\"How do I buck on about all this? You don\\'t mind, do you? He\\'s putting\\nup for Zizi, you know.\"\\n \\n\"Is Zizi really a duke, too?\"\\n \\n\"I shouldn\\'t wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the\\ncount.\"\\n \\n\"Where did you go with him?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand\\ndollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?\"\\n \\n\"Around two thousand.\"\\n \\n\"Lot of money. I told him I couldn\\'t do it. He was awfully nice about\\nit. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.\"\\n \\nBrett laughed.\\n \\n\"I say, you are slow on the up-take,\" she said. I had only sipped my\\nbrandy and soda. I took a long drink.\\n \\n\"That\\'s better. Very funny,\" Brett said. \"Then he wanted me to go to\\nCannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo.\\nTold him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many\\npeople everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here.\"\\n \\nShe looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. \"Don\\'t look\\nlike that,\" she said. \"Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don\\'t\\nlook like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to\\ndinner to-morrow night. Like to go?\"\\n \\n\"Why not?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'d better go now.\"\\n \\n\"Why?\"\\n \\n\"Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come\\ndown? He\\'s got the car just up the street.\"\\n \\n\"The count?\"\\n \\n\"Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have\\nbreakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli\\'s. Dozen bottles of\\nMumms. Tempt you?\"\\n \\n\"I have to work in the morning,\" I said. \"I\\'m too far behind you now to\\ncatch up and be any fun.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be an ass.\"\\n \\n\"Can\\'t do it.\"\\n \\n\"Right. Send him a tender message?\"\\n \\n\"Anything. Absolutely.\"\\n \\n\"Good night, darling.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be sentimental.\"\\n \\n\"You make me ill.\"\\n \\nWe kissed good night and Brett shivered. \"I\\'d better go,\" she said.\\n\"Good night, darling.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t have to go.\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\nWe kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the\\nconcierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and\\nfrom the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big\\nlimousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it\\nstarted off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a\\nglass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen\\nand poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in\\nthe dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into\\nbed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought\\nof her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last\\nseen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is\\nawfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at\\nnight it is another thing.\\n \\nIn the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for\\ncoffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in\\nthe Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant\\nearly-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee\\nand then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the\\nmarket and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the\\nlaw school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams\\nand people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the\\nMadeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked\\nalong the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I\\npassed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I\\nstepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl\\nassistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the\\nthread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy.\\nThree more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a\\nman who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the\\nsidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt\\npleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in\\nto my office.\\n \\nUp-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and\\nthen sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning\\'s work. At eleven\\no\\'clock I went over to the Quai d\\'Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat\\nwith about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece,\\na young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles,\\ntalked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the\\nCouncil was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.\\nSeveral people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a\\ncouple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the\\nanswers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d\\'Orsay\\nwith Woolsey and Krum.\\n \\n\"What do you do nights, Jake?\" asked Krum. \"I never see you around.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I\\'m over in the Quarter.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m coming over some night. The Dingo. That\\'s the great place, isn\\'t\\nit?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve meant to get over,\" said Krum. \"You know how it is, though, with a\\nwife and kids.\"\\n \\n\"Playing any tennis?\" Woolsey asked.\\n \\n\"Well, no,\" said Krum. \"I can\\'t say I\\'ve played any this year. I\\'ve\\ntried to get away, but Sundays it\\'s always rained, and the courts are so\\ndamned crowded.\"\\n \\n\"The Englishmen all have Saturday off,\" Woolsey said.\\n \\n\"Lucky beggars,\" said Krum. \"Well, I\\'ll tell you. Some day I\\'m not going\\nto be working for an agency. Then I\\'ll have plenty of time to get out in\\nthe country.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.\"\\n \\nI banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. \"Here\\'s my street,\" I\\nsaid. \"Come in and have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Thanks, old man,\" Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. \"I\\'ve got to file\\nthat line he got off this morning.\"\\n \\nI put a two-franc piece in Krum\\'s hand.\\n \\n\"You\\'re crazy, Jake,\" he said. \"This is on me.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s all on the office, anyway.\"\\n \\n\"Nope. I want to get it.\"\\n \\nI waved good-by. Krum put his head out. \"See you at the lunch on\\nWednesday.\"\\n \\n\"You bet.\"\\n \\nI went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me.\\n\"Hello, Jake,\" he said. \"Going out to lunch?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Let me see if there is anything new.\"\\n \\n\"Where will we eat?\"\\n \\n\"Anywhere.\"\\n \\nI was looking over my desk. \"Where do you want to eat?\"\\n \\n\"How about Wetzel\\'s? They\\'ve got good hors d\\'oeuvres.\"\\n \\nIn the restaurant we ordered hors d\\'oeuvres and beer. The sommelier\\nbrought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold.\\nThere were a dozen different dishes of hors d\\'oeuvres.\\n \\n\"Have any fun last night?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"No. I don\\'t think so.\"\\n \\n\"How\\'s the writing going?\"\\n \\n\"Rotten. I can\\'t get this second book going.\"\\n \\n\"That happens to everybody.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I\\'m sure of that. It gets me worried, though.\"\\n \\n\"Thought any more about going to South America?\"\\n \\n\"I mean that.\"\\n \\n\"Well, why don\\'t you start off?\"\\n \\n\"Frances.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"take her with you.\"\\n \\n\"She wouldn\\'t like it. That isn\\'t the sort of thing she likes. She likes\\na lot of people around.\"\\n \\n\"Tell her to go to hell.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t. I\\'ve got certain obligations to her.\"\\n \\nHe shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.\\n \\n\"What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"Her name\\'s Lady Ashley. Brett\\'s her own name. She\\'s a nice girl,\" I\\nsaid. \"She\\'s getting a divorce and she\\'s going to marry Mike Campbell.\\nHe\\'s over in Scotland now. Why?\"\\n \\n\"She\\'s a remarkably attractive woman.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t she?\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to\\nbe absolutely fine and straight.\"\\n \\n\"She\\'s very nice.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know how to describe the quality,\" Cohn said. \"I suppose it\\'s\\nbreeding.\"\\n \\n\"You sound as though you liked her pretty well.\"\\n \\n\"I do. I shouldn\\'t wonder if I were in love with her.\"\\n \\n\"She\\'s a drunk,\" I said. \"She\\'s in love with Mike Campbell, and she\\'s\\ngoing to marry him. He\\'s going to be rich as hell some day.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t believe she\\'ll ever marry him.\"\\n \\n\"Why not?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t believe it. Have you known her a long time?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the\\nwar.\"\\n \\n\"She must have been just a kid then.\"\\n \\n\"She\\'s thirty-four now.\"\\n \\n\"When did she marry Ashley?\"\\n \\n\"During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the\\ndysentery.\"\\n \\n\"You talk sort of bitter.\"\\n \\n\"Sorry. I didn\\'t mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t believe she would marry anybody she didn\\'t love.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said. \"She\\'s done it twice.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t believe it.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"don\\'t ask me a lot of fool questions if you don\\'t like\\nthe answers.\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t ask you that.\"\\n \\n\"You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t ask you to insult her.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, go to hell.\"\\n \\nHe stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and\\nangry behind the little plates of hors d\\'oeuvres.\\n \\n\"Sit down,\" I said. \"Don\\'t be a fool.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ve got to take that back.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.\"\\n \\n\"Take it back.\"\\n \\n\"Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How\\'s that?\\n \\n\"No. Not that. About me going to hell.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, don\\'t go to hell,\" I said. \"Stick around. We\\'re just starting\\nlunch.\"\\n \\nCohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the\\nhell would he have done if he hadn\\'t sat down? \"You say such damned\\ninsulting things, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty\\nthings.\"\\n \\n\"I know it,\" Cohn said. \"You\\'re really about the best friend I have,\\nJake.\"\\n \\nGod help you, I thought. \"Forget what I said,\" I said out loud. \"I\\'m\\nsorry.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s all right. It\\'s fine. I was just sore for a minute.\"\\n \\n\"Good. Let\\'s get something else to eat.\"\\n \\nAfter we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had\\ncoffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him\\noff it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to\\nthe office.\\n \\nAt five o\\'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was\\nnot there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good\\nletters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.\\nBrett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar\\nand had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the\\nbar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a\\ntaxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges\\nbeing towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the\\nsweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was\\nalways pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.\\n \\nThe taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in\\ndoing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let\\nthat part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull\\nriding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between\\nFontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and\\ndull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that\\nmakes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris\\nas ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking\\ndown at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read\\nsomething about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of\\nParis. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris.\\nPossibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men\\nget their likes and dislikes from Mencken.\\n \\nThe taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in\\nMontparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank\\nof the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it\\nwill probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the\\nsad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside\\nat the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of\\nsaucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.\\n \\n\"Sit down,\" said Harvey, \"I\\'ve been looking for you.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"Nothing. Just looking for you.\"\\n \\n\"Been out to the races?\"\\n \\n\"No. Not since Sunday.\"\\n \\n\"What do you hear from the States?\"\\n \\n\"Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'m through with them. I\\'m absolutely through with them.\"\\n \\nHe leaned forward and looked me in the eye.\\n \\n\"Do you want to know something, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"I haven\\'t had anything to eat for five days.\"\\n \\nI figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had\\nwon two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"No money. Money hasn\\'t come,\" he paused. \"I tell you it\\'s strange,\\nJake. When I\\'m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my\\nown room. I\\'m like a cat.\"\\n \\nI felt in my pocket.\\n \\n\"Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"Come on. Let\\'s go and eat.\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s no hurry. Have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Better eat.\"\\n \\n\"No. When I get like this I don\\'t care whether I eat or not.\"\\n \\nWe had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.\\n \\n\"Do you know Mencken, Harvey?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Why?\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s he like?\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had\\ndinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. \\'The trouble is,\\' he said,\\n\\'he\\'s a garter snapper.\\' That\\'s not bad.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s not bad.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s through now,\" Harvey went on. \"He\\'s written about all the things\\nhe knows, and now he\\'s on all the things he doesn\\'t know.\"\\n \\n\"I guess he\\'s all right,\" I said. \"I just can\\'t read him.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, nobody reads him now,\" Harvey said, \"except the people that used to\\nread the Alexander Hamilton Institute.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said. \"That was a good thing, too.\"\\n \\n\"Sure,\" said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.\\n \\n\"Have another port?\"\\n \\n\"All right,\" said Harvey.\\n \\n\"There comes Cohn,\" I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.\\n \\n\"That moron,\" said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.\\n \\n\"Hello, you bums,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Hello, Robert,\" Harvey said. \"I was just telling Jake here that you\\'re\\na moron.\"\\n \\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n \\n\"Tell us right off. Don\\'t think. What would you rather do if you could\\ndo anything you wanted?\"\\n \\nCohn started to consider.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t think. Bring it right out.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Cohn said. \"What\\'s it all about, anyway?\"\\n \\n\"I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No\\nmatter how silly it is.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Cohn said. \"I think I\\'d rather play football again with\\nwhat I know about handling myself, now.\"\\n \\n\"I misjudged you,\" Harvey said. \"You\\'re not a moron. You\\'re only a case\\nof arrested development.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re awfully funny, Harvey,\" Cohn said. \"Some day somebody will push\\nyour face in.\"\\n \\nHarvey Stone laughed. \"You think so. They won\\'t, though. Because it\\nwouldn\\'t make any difference to me. I\\'m not a fighter.\"\\n \\n\"It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.\"\\n \\n\"No, it wouldn\\'t. That\\'s where you make your big mistake. Because you\\'re\\nnot intelligent.\"\\n \\n\"Cut it out about me.\"\\n \\n\"Sure,\" said Harvey. \"It doesn\\'t make any difference to me. You don\\'t\\nmean anything to me.\"\\n \\n\"Come on, Harvey,\" I said. \"Have another porto.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" he said. \"I\\'m going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.\"\\n \\nHe walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street\\nthrough the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.\\n \\n\"He always gets me sore,\" Cohn said. \"I can\\'t stand him.\"\\n \\n\"I like him,\" I said. \"I\\'m fond of him. You don\\'t want to get sore at\\nhim.\"\\n \\n\"I know it,\" Cohn said. \"He just gets on my nerves.\"\\n \\n\"Write this afternoon?\"\\n \\n\"No. I couldn\\'t get it going. It\\'s harder to do than my first book. I\\'m\\nhaving a hard time handling it.\"\\n \\nThe sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America\\nearly in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only\\nwith these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone.\\nSomehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that\\nuntil he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that\\nwould, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on\\nthe tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he\\nhandled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of\\nundergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said\\nstood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may\\nbe called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not\\nbelieve he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed\\nat Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had\\ntrained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never\\nbeen trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He\\nloved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for\\ninstance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he\\nfell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat\\nhim who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.\\n \\nAnyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey\\nStone had just crossed the street.\\n \\n\"Come on up to the Lilas,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I have a date.\"\\n \\n\"What time?\"\\n \\n\"Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen.\"\\n \\n\"There she is.\"\\n \\nFrances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a\\nvery tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and\\nsmiled. We watched her cross the street.\\n \\n\"Hello,\" she said, \"I\\'m so glad you\\'re here, Jake. I\\'ve been wanting to\\ntalk to you.\"\\n \\n\"Hello, Frances,\" said Cohn. He smiled.\\n \\n\"Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?\" She went on, talking rapidly. \"I\\'ve\\nhad the darndest time. This one\"--shaking her head at Cohn--\"didn\\'t come\\nhome for lunch.\"\\n \\n\"I wasn\\'t supposed to.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I know. But you didn\\'t say anything about it to the cook. Then I\\nhad a date myself, and Paula wasn\\'t at her office. I went to the Ritz\\nand waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn\\'t have\\nenough money to lunch at the Ritz----\"\\n \\n\"What did you do?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, went out, of course.\" She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful\\nmanner. \"I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I\\nought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?\"\\n \\n\"Fine.\"\\n \\n\"That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that\\nBrett one.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you like her?\" Cohn asked.\\n \\n\"I think she\\'s perfectly charming. Don\\'t you?\"\\n \\nCohn said nothing.\\n \\n\"Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the\\nDome? You\\'ll stay here, won\\'t you, Robert? Come on, Jake.\"\\n \\nWe crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy\\ncame up with the  , and I bought one and opened it.\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter, Frances?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, nothing,\" she said, \"except that he wants to leave me.\"\\n \\n\"How do you mean?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my\\nmother and every one, and now he doesn\\'t want to do it.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s decided he hasn\\'t lived enough. I knew it would happen when he\\nwent to New York.\"\\n \\nShe looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.\\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t marry him if he doesn\\'t want to. Of course I wouldn\\'t. I\\nwouldn\\'t marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a\\nlittle late now, after we\\'ve waited three years, and I\\'ve just gotten my\\ndivorce.\"\\n \\nI said nothing.\\n \\n\"We were going to celebrate so, and instead we\\'ve just had scenes. It\\'s\\nso childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be\\nreasonable, but he says he just can\\'t do it.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s rotten luck.\"\\n \\n\"I should say it is rotten luck. I\\'ve wasted two years and a half on him\\nnow. And I don\\'t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two\\nyears ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the\\nold ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy\\nabout me. Now I don\\'t think I could get anybody.\"\\n \\n\"Sure, you could marry anybody.\"\\n \\n\"No, I don\\'t believe it. And I\\'m fond of him, too. And I\\'d like to have\\nchildren. I always thought we\\'d have children.\"\\n \\nShe looked at me very brightly. \"I never liked children much, but I\\ndon\\'t want to think I\\'ll never have them. I always thought I\\'d have them\\nand then like them.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s got children.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes. He\\'s got children, and he\\'s got money, and he\\'s got a rich\\nmother, and he\\'s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff;\\nnobody at all. It isn\\'t bad, either. And I haven\\'t got any money at all.\\nI could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.\"\\n \\nShe looked at me again very brightly.\\n \\n\"It isn\\'t right. It\\'s my own fault and it\\'s not, too. I ought to have\\nknown better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can\\'t marry.\\nWhy can\\'t he marry? I\\'d be a good wife. I\\'m easy to get along with. I\\nleave him alone. It doesn\\'t do any good.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a rotten shame.\"\\n \\n\"Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there\\'s no use talking about it, is\\nthere? Come on, let\\'s go back to the café.\"\\n \\n\"And of course there isn\\'t anything I can do.\"\\n \\n\"No. Just don\\'t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.\" Now\\nfor the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. \"He\\nwants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out\\nso when a lot of little chickens like it. That\\'s what he wants.\"\\n \\n\"Maybe they won\\'t like it. I don\\'t think he\\'s that way. Really.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t know him like I do, Jake. That\\'s what he wants to do. I know\\nit. I know it. That\\'s why he doesn\\'t want to marry. He wants to have a\\nbig triumph this fall all by himself.\"\\n \\n\"Want to go back to the café?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Come on.\"\\n \\nWe got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink--and started\\nacross the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from\\nbehind the marble-topped table.\\n \\n\"Well, what are you smiling at?\" Frances asked him. \"Feel pretty happy?\"\\n \\n\"I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, what I\\'ve told Jake isn\\'t any secret. Everybody will know it soon\\nenough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.\"\\n \\n\"What was it? About your going to England?\"\\n \\n\"Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I\\'m\\ngoing to England.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t that fine!\"\\n \\n\"Yes, that\\'s the way it\\'s done in the very best families. Robert\\'s\\nsending me. He\\'s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I\\'m going\\nto visit friends. Won\\'t it be lovely? The friends don\\'t know about it,\\nyet.\"\\n \\nShe turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.\\n \\n\"You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren\\'t you, Robert?\\nBut I made him give me two hundred. He\\'s really very generous. Aren\\'t\\nyou, Robert?\"\\n \\nI do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.\\nThere are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give\\nyou a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be\\ndestroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was\\nCohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did\\nnot even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly\\njoking to what went on later.\\n \\n\"How can you say such things, Frances?\" Cohn interrupted.\\n \\n\"Listen to him. I\\'m going to England. I\\'m going to visit friends. Ever\\nvisit friends that didn\\'t want you? Oh, they\\'ll have to take me, all\\nright. \\'How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we\\'ve seen you.\\nAnd how is your dear mother?\\' Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all\\nher money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person\\nin the world that did. \\'And what about Robert?\\' or else very careful\\ntalking around Robert. \\'You must be most careful not to mention him, my\\ndear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.\\' Won\\'t it be\\nfun, Robert? Don\\'t you think it will be fun, Jake?\"\\n \\nShe turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very\\nsatisfactory to her to have an audience for this.\\n \\n\"And where are you going to be, Robert? It\\'s my own fault, all right.\\nPerfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary\\non the magazine I ought to have known you\\'d get rid of me the same way.\\nJake doesn\\'t know about that. Should I tell him?\"\\n \\n\"Shut up, Frances, for God\\'s sake.\"\\n \\n\"Yes, I\\'ll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just\\nthe sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was\\nwonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful,\\ntoo. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to\\nProvincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn\\'t even\\npay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was\\npretty fine, then. Didn\\'t you, Robert?\\n \\n\"You mustn\\'t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the\\nsecretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that\\nshe was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that\\nwe that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn\\'t that\\nliterary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.\\n \\n\"You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren\\'t you,\\nRobert? That\\'s why he\\'s leaving me. He\\'s decided I don\\'t film well. You\\nsee, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing\\non this book, that he doesn\\'t remember anything about us. So now he\\'s\\ngoing out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something\\nfrightfully interesting.\\n \\n\"Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won\\'t mind, will\\nyou? Don\\'t have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you\\ncan\\'t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you\\ncan\\'t remember what the other person\\'s said. You\\'ll never be able to\\nremember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it\\'s\\nawfully hard. But remember, it\\'s for literature. We all ought to make\\nsacrifices for literature. Look at me. I\\'m going to England without a\\nprotest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don\\'t you\\nthink so, Jake? But you\\'re not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You\\'re\\nthirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at\\nHardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert\\ndoesn\\'t think he\\'s any good, though. Some of his French friends told\\nhim. He doesn\\'t read French very well himself. He wasn\\'t a good writer\\nlike you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look\\nfor material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he\\nwouldn\\'t marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I\\'ve just thought of\\nsomething.\" She put her gloved hand up to her lips. \"I know the real\\nreason why Robert won\\'t marry me, Jake. It\\'s just come to me. They\\'ve\\nsent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn\\'t it mystic? Some day\\nthey\\'ll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert?\\nI\\'ll tell you. It\\'s so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it.\\nWhy, you see, Robert\\'s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he\\ndoesn\\'t marry me, why, then he\\'s had one. She was his mistress for over\\ntwo years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he\\'s always\\npromised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don\\'t you\\nthink that\\'s bright of me to figure that out? It\\'s true, too. Look at\\nhim and see if it\\'s not. Where are you going, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.\"\\n \\nCohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there?\\nWhy did he keep on taking it like that?\\n \\nAs I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the\\nwindow. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into\\nhis face each time she asked: \"Isn\\'t it so, Robert?\" Or maybe she did\\nnot ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I\\ndid not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I\\nwent out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and\\nsaw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side\\nstreet to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave\\nthe driver the address of my flat.\\n \\nAs I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the\\ndoor of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters\\nand a telegram.\\n \\n\"Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.\"\\n \\n\"Did she leave a card?\"\\n \\n\"No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night.\\nIn the end I find she is very nice.\"\\n \\n\"Was she with a friend of mine?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very\\nlarge. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps,\\na little--\" She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.\\n\"I\\'ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her\\nnot so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to\\nwhat I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family.\\nIt is a thing you can see.\"\\n \\n\"They did not leave any word?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.\"\\n \\n\"Send them up when they come.\"\\n \\n\"Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An\\neccentric, perhaps, but quelqu\\'une, quelqu\\'une!\"\\n \\nThe concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling\\nconcession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse,\\nbut she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great\\npride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were\\nof good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the\\naccent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall\\ninto any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was\\nno one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely\\nunderfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither\\nwell brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter\\nasking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could\\ncome up and see me occasionally in the evenings.\\n \\nI went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.\\nThe wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the\\n . I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom,\\nundressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the\\ndoor-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.\\nIt was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of\\nroses.\\n \\n\"Hello, darling,\" said Brett. \"Aren\\'t you going to let us in?\"\\n \\n\"Come on. I was just bathing.\"\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t you the fortunate man. Bathing.\"\\n \\n\"Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know whether you like flowers, sir,\" the count said, \"but I\\ntook the liberty of just bringing these roses.\"\\n \\n\"Here, give them to me.\" Brett took them. \"Get me some water in this,\\nJake.\" I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and\\nBrett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the\\ndining-room table.\\n \\n\"I say. We have had a day.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?\"\\n \\n\"No. Did we have one? I must have been blind.\"\\n \\n\"You were quite drunk, my dear,\" said the count.\\n \\n\"Wasn\\'t I, though? And the count\\'s been a brick, absolutely.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ve got hell\\'s own drag with the concierge now.\"\\n \\n\"I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be a damned fool.\"\\n \\n\"His,\" she said, and nodded at the count.\\n \\n\"I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It\\nwas very late.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s wonderful,\" Brett said. \"He remembers everything that\\'s happened.\"\\n \\n\"So do you, my dear.\"\\n \\n\"Fancy,\" said Brett. \"Who\\'d want to? I say, Jake,   we get a drink?\"\\n \\n\"You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.\"\\n \\n\"Rather.\"\\n \\nWhile I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and\\nthen heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt\\ntired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand,\\nand sat on the bed.\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?\"\\n \\nShe kissed me coolly on the forehead.\\n \\n\"Oh, Brett, I love you so much.\"\\n \\n\"Darling,\" she said. Then: \"Do you want me to send him away?\"\\n \\n\"No. He\\'s nice.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll send him away.\"\\n \\n\"No, don\\'t.\"\\n \\n\"Yes, I\\'ll send him away.\"\\n \\n\"You can\\'t just like that.\"\\n \\n\"Can\\'t I, though? You stay here. He\\'s mad about me, I tell you.\"\\n \\nShe was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a\\nbad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and\\nsat on the bed.\\n \\n\"Poor old darling.\" She stroked my head.\\n \\n\"What did you say to him?\" I was lying with my face away from her. I did\\nnot want to see her.\\n \\n\"Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.\"\\n \\nThen later: \"Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s better.\"\\n \\n\"Lie quiet. He\\'s gone to the other side of town.\"\\n \\n\"Couldn\\'t we live together, Brett? Couldn\\'t we just live together?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t think so. I\\'d just   you with everybody. You couldn\\'t\\nstand it.\"\\n \\n\"I stand it now.\"\\n \\n\"That would be different. It\\'s my fault, Jake. It\\'s the way I\\'m made.\"\\n \\n\"Couldn\\'t we go off in the country for a while?\"\\n \\n\"It wouldn\\'t be any good. I\\'ll go if you like. But I couldn\\'t live\\nquietly in the country. Not with my own true love.\"\\n \\n\"I know.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t it rotten? There isn\\'t any use my telling you I love you.\"\\n \\n\"You know I love you.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s not talk. Talking\\'s all bilge. I\\'m going away from you, and then\\nMichael\\'s coming back.\"\\n \\n\"Why are you going away?\"\\n \\n\"Better for you. Better for me.\"\\n \\n\"When are you going?\"\\n \\n\"Soon as I can.\"\\n \\n\"Where?\"\\n \\n\"San Sebastian.\"\\n \\n\"Can\\'t we go together?\"\\n \\n\"No. That would be a hell of an idea after we\\'d just talked it out.\"\\n \\n\"We never agreed.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, you know as well as I do. Don\\'t be obstinate, darling.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"I know you\\'re right. I\\'m just low, and when I\\'m low\\nI talk like a fool.\"\\n \\nI sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I\\nstood up.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t look like that, darling.\"\\n \\n\"How do you want me to look?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, don\\'t be a fool. I\\'m going away to-morrow.\"\\n \\n\"To-morrow?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Didn\\'t I say so? I am.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s have a drink, then. The count will be back.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. He should be back. You know he\\'s extraordinary about buying\\nchampagne. It means any amount to him.\"\\n \\nWe went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured\\nBrett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I\\nwent to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur\\ncarrying a basket of champagne.\\n \\n\"Where should I have him put it, sir?\" asked the count.\\n \\n\"In the kitchen,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Put it in there, Henry,\" the count motioned. \"Now go down and get the\\nice.\" He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. \"I\\nthink you\\'ll find that\\'s very good wine,\" he said. \"I know we don\\'t get\\nmuch of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this\\nfrom a friend of mine that\\'s in the business.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, you always have some one in the trade,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"This fellow raises the grapes. He\\'s got thousands of acres of them.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s his name?\" asked Brett. \"Veuve Cliquot?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" said the count. \"Mumms. He\\'s a baron.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t it wonderful,\" said Brett. \"We all have titles. Why haven\\'t you a\\ntitle, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"I assure you, sir,\" the count put his hand on my arm. \"It never does a\\nman any good. Most of the time it costs you money.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know. It\\'s damned useful sometimes,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I\\'ve never known it to do me any good.\"\\n \\n\"You haven\\'t used it properly. I\\'ve had hell\\'s own amount of credit on\\nmine.\"\\n \\n\"Do sit down, count,\" I said. \"Let me take that stick.\"\\n \\nThe count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She\\nwas smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me\\nnotice it. \"I say, Jake, I don\\'t want to ruin your rugs. Can\\'t you give\\na chap an ash-tray?\"\\n \\nI found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up\\nwith a bucket full of salted ice. \"Put two bottles in it, Henry,\" the\\ncount called.\\n \\n\"Anything else, sir?\"\\n \\n\"No. Wait down in the car.\" He turned to Brett and to me. \"We\\'ll want to\\nride out to the Bois for dinner?\"\\n \\n\"If you like,\" Brett said. \"I couldn\\'t eat a thing.\"\\n \\n\"I always like a good meal,\" said the count.\\n \\n\"Should I bring the wine in, sir?\" asked the chauffeur.\\n \\n\"Yes. Bring it in, Henry,\" said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin\\ncigar-case and offered it to me. \"Like to try a real American cigar?\"\\n \\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I\\'ll finish the cigarette.\"\\n \\nHe cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of\\nhis watch-chain.\\n \\n\"I like a cigar to really draw,\" said the count \"Half the cigars you\\nsmoke don\\'t draw.\"\\n \\nHe lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. \"And\\nwhen you\\'re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won\\'t have a title.\"\\n \\n\"No. What a pity.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" said the count. \"You don\\'t need a title. You got class all over\\nyou.\"\\n \\n\"Thanks. Awfully decent of you.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not joking you,\" the count blew a cloud of smoke. \"You got the most\\nclass of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That\\'s all.\"\\n \\n\"Nice of you,\" said Brett. \"Mummy would be pleased. Couldn\\'t you write\\nit out, and I\\'ll send it in a letter to her.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'d tell her, too,\" said the count. \"I\\'m not joking you. I never joke\\npeople. Joke people and you make enemies. That\\'s what I always say.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re right,\" Brett said. \"You\\'re terribly right. I always joke people\\nand I haven\\'t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t joke him.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\n \\n\"Do you, now?\" asked the count. \"Do you joke him?\"\\n \\nBrett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.\\n \\n\"No,\" she said. \"I wouldn\\'t joke him.\"\\n \\n\"See,\" said the count. \"You don\\'t joke him.\"\\n \\n\"This is a hell of a dull talk,\" Brett said. \"How about some of that\\nchampagne?\"\\n \\nThe count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. \"It\\nisn\\'t cold, yet. You\\'re always drinking, my dear. Why don\\'t you just\\ntalk?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve talked too ruddy much. I\\'ve talked myself all out to Jake.\"\\n \\n\"I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you\\nnever finish your sentences at all.\"\\n \\n\"Leave \\'em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.\"\\n \\n\"It is a very interesting system,\" the count reached down and gave the\\nbottles a twirl. \"Still I would like to hear you talk some time.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t he a fool?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"Now,\" the count brought up a bottle. \"I think this is cool.\"\\n \\nI brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. \"I like to\\ndrink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been\\ntoo hard to cool.\" He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the\\nglasses.\\n \\n\"I say. You might open it,\" Brett suggested.\\n \\n\"Yes, my dear. Now I\\'ll open it.\"\\n \\nIt was amazing champagne.\\n \\n\"I say that is wine,\" Brett held up her glass. \"We ought to toast\\nsomething. \\'Here\\'s to royalty.\\'\"\\n \\n\"This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don\\'t want to\\nmix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.\"\\n \\nBrett\\'s glass was empty.\\n \\n\"You ought to write a book on wines, count,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Mr. Barnes,\" answered the count, \"all I want out of wines is to enjoy\\nthem.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s enjoy a little more of this,\" Brett pushed her glass forward. The\\ncount poured very carefully. \"There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly,\\nand then you can get drunk.\"\\n \\n\"Drunk? Drunk?\"\\n \\n\"My dear, you are charming when you are drunk.\"\\n \\n\"Listen to the man.\"\\n \\n\"Mr. Barnes,\" the count poured my glass full. \"She is the only lady I\\nhave ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was\\nsober.\"\\n \\n\"You haven\\'t been around much, have you?\"\\n \\n\"Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very\\ngreat deal.\"\\n \\n\"Drink your wine,\" said Brett. \"We\\'ve all been around. I dare say Jake\\nhere has seen as much as you have.\"\\n \\n\"My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don\\'t think I don\\'t think\\nso, sir. I have seen a lot, too.\"\\n \\n\"Of course you have, my dear,\" Brett said. \"I was only ragging.\"\\n \\n\"I have been in seven wars and four revolutions,\" the count said.\\n \\n\"Soldiering?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen\\narrow wounds?\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s have a look at them.\"\\n \\nThe count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled\\nup the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big\\nstomach muscles bulging under the light.\\n \\n\"You see them?\"\\n \\nBelow the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. \"See\\non the back where they come out.\" Above the small of the back were the\\nsame two scars, raised as thick as a finger.\\n \\n\"I say. Those are something.\"\\n \\n\"Clean through.\"\\n \\nThe count was tucking in his shirt.\\n \\n\"Where did you get those?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.\"\\n \\n\"What were you doing?\" asked Brett. \"Were you in the army?\"\\n \\n\"I was on a business trip, my dear.\"\\n \\n\"I told you he was one of us. Didn\\'t I?\" Brett turned to me. \"I love\\nyou, count. You\\'re a darling.\"\\n \\n\"You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn\\'t true.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be an ass.\"\\n \\n\"You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I\\ncan enjoy everything so well. Don\\'t you find it like that?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Absolutely.\"\\n \\n\"I know,\" said the count. \"That is the secret. You must get to know the\\nvalues.\"\\n \\n\"Doesn\\'t anything ever happen to your values?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"No. Not any more.\"\\n \\n\"Never fall in love?\"\\n \\n\"Always,\" said the count. \"I am always in love.\"\\n \\n\"What does that do to your values?\"\\n \\n\"That, too, has got a place in my values.\"\\n \\n\"You haven\\'t any values. You\\'re dead, that\\'s all.\"\\n \\n\"No, my dear. You\\'re not right. I\\'m not dead at all.\"\\n \\nWe drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in\\nmy kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner.\\nFood had an excellent place in the count\\'s values. So did wine. The\\ncount was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good\\nparty.\\n \\n\"Where would you like to go?\" asked the count after dinner. We were the\\nonly people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over\\nagainst the door. They wanted to go home.\\n \\n\"We might go up on the hill,\" Brett said. \"Haven\\'t we had a splendid\\nparty?\"\\n \\nThe count was beaming. He was very happy.\\n \\n\"You are very nice people,\" he said. He was smoking a cigar again. \"Why\\ndon\\'t you get married, you two?\"\\n \\n\"We want to lead our own lives,\" I said.\\n \\n\"We have our careers,\" Brett said. \"Come on. Let\\'s get out of this.\"\\n \\n\"Have another brandy,\" the count said.\\n \\n\"Get it on the hill.\"\\n \\n\"No. Have it here where it is quiet.\"\\n \\n\"You and your quiet,\" said Brett. \"What is it men feel about quiet?\"\\n \\n\"We like it,\" said the count. \"Like you like noise, my dear.\"\\n \\n\"All right,\" said Brett. \"Let\\'s have one.\"\\n \\n\"Sommelier!\" the count called.\\n \\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n \\n\"What is the oldest brandy you have?\"\\n \\n\"Eighteen eleven, sir.\"\\n \\n\"Bring us a bottle.\"\\n \\n\"I say. Don\\'t be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in\\nany other antiquities.\"\\n \\n\"Got many antiquities?\"\\n \\n\"I got a houseful.\"\\n \\nFinally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli\\'s it was crowded, smoky,\\nand noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was\\nso crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We\\nwere caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him.\\n \\n\"Hahre you?\"\\n \\n\"Great.\"\\n \\n\"Thaats good.\"\\n \\nHe was all teeth and lips.\\n \\n\"He\\'s a great friend of mine,\" Brett said. \"Damn good drummer.\"\\n \\nThe music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat.\\nThen the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He\\nwas sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again.\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go over.\"\\n \\nBrett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced,\\ntight in the crowd.\\n \\n\"You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael\\'s the best dancer I know.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s splendid.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s got his points.\"\\n \\n\"I like him,\" I said. \"I\\'m damned fond of him.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m going to marry him,\" Brett said. \"Funny. I haven\\'t thought about\\nhim for a week.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you write him?\"\\n \\n\"Not I. Never write letters.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll bet he writes to you.\"\\n \\n\"Rather. Damned good letters, too.\"\\n \\n\"When are you going to get married?\"\\n \\n\"How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael\\'s trying to\\nget his mother to put up for it.\"\\n \\n\"Could I help you?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be an ass. Michael\\'s people have loads of money.\"\\n \\nThe music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up.\\n \\n\"Very nice,\" he said. \"You looked very, very nice.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you dance, count?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"No. I\\'m too old.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, come off it,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you\\ndance.\"\\n \\n\"Splendid,\" Brett said. \"I\\'ll dance again for you some time. I say. What\\nabout your little friend, Zizi?\"\\n \\n\"Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don\\'t want to have him\\naround.\"\\n \\n\"He is rather hard.\"\\n \\n\"You know I think that boy\\'s got a future. But personally I don\\'t want\\nhim around.\"\\n \\n\"Jake\\'s rather the same way.\"\\n \\n\"He gives me the willys.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" the count shrugged his shoulders. \"About his future you can\\'t\\never tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.\"\\n \\n\"Come on. Let\\'s dance,\" Brett said.\\n \\nWe danced. It was crowded and close.\\n \\n\"Oh, darling,\" Brett said, \"I\\'m so miserable.\"\\n \\nI had that feeling of going through something that has all happened\\nbefore. \"You were happy a minute ago.\"\\n \\nThe drummer shouted: \"You can\\'t two time--\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s all gone.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. I just feel terribly.\"\\n \\n\"......\" the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks.\\n \\n\"Want to go?\"\\n \\nI had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated,\\nsomething I had been through and that now I must go through again.\\n \\n\"......\" the drummer sang softly.\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go,\" said Brett. \"You don\\'t mind.\"\\n \\n\"......\" the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.\\n \\n\"All right,\" I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the\\ndressing-room.\\n \\n\"Brett wants to go,\" I said to the count. He nodded. \"Does she? That\\'s\\nfine. You take the car. I\\'m going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes.\"\\n \\nWe shook hands.\\n \\n\"It was a wonderful time,\" I said. \"I wish you would let me get this.\" I\\ntook a note out of my pocket.\\n \\n\"Mr. Barnes, don\\'t be ridiculous,\" the count said.\\n \\nBrett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand\\non his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I\\nlooked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big\\ncar. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.\\n \\n\"No, don\\'t come up,\" she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door\\nwas unlatched.\\n \\n\"Really?\"\\n \\n\"No. Please.\"\\n \\n\"Good night, Brett,\" I said. \"I\\'m sorry you feel rotten.\"\\n \\n\"Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won\\'t see you again.\" We\\nkissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. \"Oh,\\ndon\\'t!\" Brett said.\\n \\nShe turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me\\naround to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and\\nsaid: \"Good night, sir,\" and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened\\nand I went up-stairs and went to bed.\\n \\nI did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One\\ncard came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said:\\n\"Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT.\"\\n \\nNor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England\\nand I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a\\ncouple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to\\nthe fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach\\nhim always, he wrote, through his bankers.\\n \\nBrett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn\\'s troubles, I rather enjoyed\\nnot having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often\\nto the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the\\noffice getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my\\nsecretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of\\nJune. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went\\noff to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful.\\nNew York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a\\nwhole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good\\nprospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very\\nhappy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to\\nmake a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he\\nwent off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave\\nfor Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He\\nwrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: \"Jake,\\nBudapest is wonderful.\" Then I got a wire: \"Back on Monday.\"\\n \\nMonday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went\\nto the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying\\nhis bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I hear you had a wonderful trip.\"\\n \\n\"Wonderful,\" he said. \"Budapest is absolutely wonderful.\"\\n \\n\"How about Vienna?\"\\n \\n\"Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was.\"\\n \\n\"How do you mean?\" I was getting glasses and a siphon.\\n \\n\"Tight, Jake. I was tight.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s strange. Better have a drink.\"\\n \\nBill rubbed his forehead. \"Remarkable thing,\" he said. \"Don\\'t know how\\nit happened. Suddenly it happened.\"\\n \\n\"Last long?\"\\n \\n\"Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days.\"\\n \\n\"Where did you go?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.\"\\n \\n\"Do anything else?\"\\n \\n\"Not so sure. Possible.\"\\n \\n\"Go on. Tell me about it.\"\\n \\n\"Can\\'t remember. Tell you anything I could remember.\"\\n \\n\"Go on. Take that drink and remember.\"\\n \\n\"Might remember a little,\" Bill said. \"Remember something about a\\nprize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember\\nthe nigger perfectly.\"\\n \\n\"Go on.\"\\n \\n\"Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big.\\nAll of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger\\'d just\\nknocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a\\nspeech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local\\nwhite boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody\\ncommenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn\\'t\\nget his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big\\nsporting evening.\"\\n \\n\"What happened?\"\\n \\n\"Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get\\nhis money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall.\\nWonder who translated? Was it me?\"\\n \\n\"Probably it wasn\\'t you.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re right. Wasn\\'t me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him\\nthe local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.\"\\n \\n\"How\\'d you come out?\"\\n \\n\"Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger\\npromised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can\\'t\\nknock out Vienna boy in Vienna. \\'My God, Mister Gorton,\\' said nigger, \\'I\\ndidn\\'t do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay.\\nThat white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit\\nhim.\\'\"\\n \\n\"Did you get any money?\"\\n \\n\"No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger\\'s clothes. Somebody took\\nhis watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not\\nso good, Jake. Not so good.\"\\n \\n\"What became of the nigger?\"\\n \\n\"Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to\\nwrite me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger.\\nHope I gave him the right address.\"\\n \\n\"You probably did.\"\\n \\n\"Well, anyway, let\\'s eat,\" said Bill. \"Unless you want me to tell you\\nsome more travel stories.\"\\n \\n\"Go on.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s eat.\"\\n \\nWe went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm\\nJune evening.\\n \\n\"Where will we go?\"\\n \\n\"Want to eat on the island?\"\\n \\n\"Sure.\"\\n \\nWe walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue\\nDenfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing\\nrobes.\\n \\n\"I know who they are.\" Bill eyed the monument. \"Gentlemen who invented\\npharmacy. Don\\'t try and fool me on Paris.\"\\n \\nWe went on.\\n \\n\"Here\\'s a taxidermist\\'s,\" Bill said. \"Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed\\ndog?\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" I said. \"You\\'re pie-eyed.\"\\n \\n\"Pretty nice stuffed dogs,\" Bill said. \"Certainly brighten up your\\nflat.\"\\n \\n\"Come on.\"\\n \\n\"Just one stuffed dog. I can take \\'em or leave \\'em alone. But listen,\\nJake. Just one stuffed dog.\"\\n \\n\"Come on.\"\\n \\n\"Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple\\nexchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll get one on the way back.\"\\n \\n\"All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought\\nstuffed dogs. Not my fault.\"\\n \\nWe went on.\\n \\n\"How\\'d you feel that way about dogs so sudden?\"\\n \\n\"Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed\\nanimals.\"\\n \\nWe stopped and had a drink.\\n \\n\"Certainly like to drink,\" Bill said. \"You ought to try it some times,\\nJake.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.\"\\n \\n\"Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never\\nbeen daunted. Never been daunted in public.\"\\n \\n\"Where were you drinking?\"\\n \\n\"Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George\\'s\\na great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll be daunted after about three more pernods.\"\\n \\n\"Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I\\'ll go off by myself. I\\'m\\nlike a cat that way.\"\\n \\n\"When did you see Harvey Stone?\"\\n \\n\"At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn\\'t eaten for\\nthree days. Doesn\\'t eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s all right.\"\\n \\n\"Splendid. Wish he wouldn\\'t keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me\\nnervous.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'ll we do to-night?\"\\n \\n\"Doesn\\'t make any difference. Only let\\'s not get daunted. Suppose they\\ngot any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we\\nwouldn\\'t have to go all the way down to the island to eat.\"\\n \\n\"Nix,\" I said. \"We\\'re going to have a regular meal.\"\\n \\n\"Just a suggestion,\" said Bill. \"Want to start now?\"\\n \\n\"Come on.\"\\n \\nWe started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill\\nlooked at it.\\n \\n\"See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for\\nChristmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I\\'m a\\nnature-writer.\"\\n \\nA taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop.\\nThe taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett.\\n \\n\"Beautiful lady,\" said Bill. \"Going to kidnap us.\"\\n \\n\"Hullo!\" Brett said. \"Hullo!\"\\n \\n\"This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley.\"\\n \\nBrett smiled at Bill. \"I say I\\'m just back. Haven\\'t bathed even. Michael\\ncomes in to-night.\"\\n \\n\"Good. Come on and eat with us, and we\\'ll all go to meet him.\"\\n \\n\"Must clean myself.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, rot! Come on.\"\\n \\n\"Must bathe. He doesn\\'t get in till nine.\"\\n \\n\"Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe.\"\\n \\n\"Might do that. Now you\\'re not talking rot.\"\\n \\nWe got in the taxi. The driver looked around.\\n \\n\"Stop at the nearest bistro,\" I said.\\n \\n\"We might as well go to the Closerie,\" Brett said. \"I can\\'t drink these\\nrotten brandies.\"\\n \\n\"Closerie des Lilas.\"\\n \\nBrett turned to Bill.\\n \\n\"Have you been in this pestilential city long?\"\\n \\n\"Just got in to-day from Budapest.\"\\n \\n\"How was Budapest?\"\\n \\n\"Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful.\"\\n \\n\"Ask him about Vienna.\"\\n \\n\"Vienna,\" said Bill, \"is a strange city.\"\\n \\n\"Very much like Paris,\" Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of\\nher eyes.\\n \\n\"Exactly,\" Bill said. \"Very much like Paris at this moment.\"\\n \\n\"You   a good start.\"\\n \\nSitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and\\nsoda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.\\n \\n\"How are you, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"Great,\" I said. \"I\\'ve had a good time.\"\\n \\nBrett looked at me. \"I was a fool to go away,\" she said. \"One\\'s an ass\\nto leave Paris.\"\\n \\n\"Did you have a good time?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.\"\\n \\n\"See anybody?\"\\n \\n\"No, hardly anybody. I never went out.\"\\n \\n\"Didn\\'t you swim?\"\\n \\n\"No. Didn\\'t do a thing.\"\\n \\n\"Sounds like Vienna,\" Bill said.\\n \\nBrett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.\\n \\n\"So that\\'s the way it was in Vienna.\"\\n \\n\"It was like everything in Vienna.\"\\n \\nBrett smiled at him again.\\n \\n\"You\\'ve a nice friend, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s all right,\" I said. \"He\\'s a taxidermist.\"\\n \\n\"That was in another country,\" Bill said. \"And besides all the animals\\nwere dead.\"\\n \\n\"One more,\" Brett said, \"and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi.\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s a line of them. Right out in front.\"\\n \\n\"Good.\"\\n \\nWe had the drink and put Brett into her taxi.\\n \\n\"Mind you\\'re at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be\\nthere.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll be there,\" Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved.\\n \\n\"Quite a girl,\" Bill said. \"She\\'s damned nice. Who\\'s Michael?\"\\n \\n\"The man she\\'s going to marry.\"\\n \\n\"Well, well,\" Bill said. \"That\\'s always just the stage I meet anybody.\\nWhat\\'ll I send them? Think they\\'d like a couple of stuffed race-horses?\"\\n \\n\"We better eat.\"\\n \\n\"Is she really Lady something or other?\" Bill asked in the taxi on our\\nway down to the Ile Saint Louis.\\n \\n\"Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.\"\\n \\n\"Well, well.\"\\n \\nWe ate dinner at Madame Lecomte\\'s restaurant on the far side of the\\nisland. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait\\nfor a place. Some one had put it in the American Women\\'s Club list as a\\nquaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so\\nwe had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the\\nrestaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte\\nmade a great fuss over seeing him.\\n \\n\"Doesn\\'t get us a table, though,\" Bill said. \"Grand woman, though.\"\\n \\nWe had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a\\nsalad, and some apple-pie and cheese.\\n \\n\"You\\'ve got the world here all right,\" Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She\\nraised her hand. \"Oh, my God!\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll be rich.\"\\n \\n\"I hope so.\"\\n \\nAfter the coffee and a   we got the bill, chalked up the same as\\never on a slate, that was doubtless one of the \"quaint\" features, paid\\nit, shook hands, and went out.\\n \\n\"You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,\" Madame Lecomte said.\\n \\n\"Too many compatriots.\"\\n \\n\"Come at lunch-time. It\\'s not crowded then.\"\\n \\n\"Good. I\\'ll be down soon.\"\\n \\nWe walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai\\nd\\'Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of\\nold houses that were being torn down.\\n \\n\"They\\'re going to cut a street through.\"\\n \\n\"They would,\" Bill said.\\n \\nWe walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau\\nmouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out\\nof sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting\\nagainst the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the\\nwooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge\\nand looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the\\nisland looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees\\nwere shadows.\\n \\n\"It\\'s pretty grand,\" Bill said. \"God, I love to get back.\"\\n \\nWe leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to\\nthe lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It\\nmade no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed\\nus. They were walking with their arms around each other.\\n \\nWe crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was\\nsteep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The\\narc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and\\nunderneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the\\ndoor of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I\\nsaw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were\\ndrinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking\\npotato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some\\nonto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in\\none hand.\\n \\n\"Want to have a drink?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" said Bill. \"I don\\'t need it.\"\\n \\nWe turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth\\nnarrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses\\njutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue\\ndu Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid\\nnorth and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val\\nde Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the\\nBoulevard du Port Royal.\\n \\n\"What do you want to do?\" I asked. \"Go up to the café and see Brett and\\nMike?\"\\n \\n\"Why not?\"\\n \\nWe walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on\\npast the Lilas, Lavigne\\'s, and all the little cafés, Damoy\\'s, crossed\\nthe street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.\\n \\nMichael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and\\nhealthy-looking.\\n \\n\"Hel-lo, Jake,\" he said. \"Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?\"\\n \\n\"You look very fit, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I am. I\\'m frightfully fit. I\\'ve done nothing but walk. Walk all day\\nlong. One drink a day with my mother at tea.\"\\n \\nBill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was\\nsitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on.\\n \\n\"It\\'s good to see you, Jake,\" Michael said. \"I\\'m a little tight you\\nknow. Amazing, isn\\'t it? Did you see my nose?\"\\n \\nThere was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.\\n \\n\"An old lady\\'s bags did that,\" Mike said. \"I reached up to help her with\\nthem and they fell on me.\"\\n \\nBrett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and\\nwrinkled the corners of her eyes.\\n \\n\"An old lady,\" said Mike. \"Her bags   on me. Let\\'s go in and see\\nBrett. I say, she is a piece. You   a lovely lady, Brett. Where did\\nyou get that hat?\"\\n \\n\"Chap bought it for me. Don\\'t you like it?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, we\\'ve so much money now,\" Brett said. \"I say, haven\\'t you met Bill\\nyet? You   a lovely host, Jake.\"\\n \\nShe turned to Mike. \"This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike\\nCampbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.\"\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London.\\nChap who did me in.\"\\n \\n\"What did he say?\"\\n \\n\"Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you\\n  a lovely piece. Don\\'t you think she\\'s beautiful?\"\\n \\n\"Beautiful. With this nose?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn\\'t she a lovely piece?\"\\n \\n\"Couldn\\'t we have kept the man in Scotland?\"\\n \\n\"I say, Brett, let\\'s turn in early.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t she a lovely piece? Don\\'t you think so, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s a fight to-night,\" Bill said. \"Like to go?\"\\n \\n\"Fight,\" said Mike. \"Who\\'s fighting?\"\\n \\n\"Ledoux and somebody.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s very good, Ledoux,\" Mike said. \"I\\'d like to see it, rather\"--he\\nwas making an effort to pull himself together--\"but I can\\'t go. I had a\\ndate with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat.\"\\n \\nBrett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from\\nunder it. \"You two run along to the fight. I\\'ll have to be taking Mr.\\nCampbell home directly.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not tight,\" Mike said. \"Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you\\nare a lovely piece.\"\\n \\n\"Go on to the fight,\" Brett said. \"Mr. Campbell\\'s getting difficult.\\nWhat are these outbursts of affection, Michael?\"\\n \\n\"I say, you are a lovely piece.\"\\n \\nWe said good night. \"I\\'m sorry I can\\'t go,\" Mike said. Brett laughed. I\\nlooked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning\\ntoward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the\\ncorners of her eyes were smiling.\\n \\nOutside on the pavement I said: \"Do you want to go to the fight?\"\\n \\n\"Sure,\" said Bill. \"If we don\\'t have to walk.\"\\n \\n\"Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend,\" I said in the taxi.\\n \\n\"Well,\" said Bill. \"You can\\'t blame him such a hell of a lot.\"\\n \\nThe Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a\\ngood fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn,\\nwritten from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing,\\nplaying some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he\\nwas anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I\\nwould buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.\\n \\nThat same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would\\nleave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him\\nat Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The\\nsame evening about seven o\\'clock I stopped in at the Select to see\\nMichael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo.\\nThey were inside sitting at the bar.\\n \\n\"Hello, darling.\" Brett put out her hand.\\n \\n\"Hello, Jake,\" Mike said. \"I understand I was tight last night.\"\\n \\n\"Weren\\'t you, though,\" Brett said. \"Disgraceful business.\"\\n \\n\"Look,\" said Mike, \"when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we\\ncame down with you?\"\\n \\n\"It would be grand.\"\\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t mind, really? I\\'ve been at Pamplona, you know. Brett\\'s mad\\nto go. You\\'re sure we wouldn\\'t just be a bloody nuisance?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t talk like a fool.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m a little tight, you know. I wouldn\\'t ask you like this if I\\nweren\\'t. You\\'re sure you don\\'t mind?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, shut up, Michael,\" Brett said. \"How can the man say he\\'d mind now?\\nI\\'ll ask him later.\"\\n \\n\"But you don\\'t mind, do you?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go\\ndown on the morning of the 25th.\"\\n \\n\"By the way, where is Bill?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"He\\'s out at Chantilly dining with some people.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s a good chap.\"\\n \\n\"Splendid chap,\" said Mike. \"He is, you know.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t remember him,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we\\'ll come down the night of\\nthe 25th. Brett can\\'t get up in the morning.\"\\n \\n\"Indeed not!\"\\n \\n\"If our money comes and you\\'re sure you don\\'t mind.\"\\n \\n\"It will come, all right. I\\'ll see to that.\"\\n \\n\"Tell me what tackle to send for.\"\\n \\n\"Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies.\"\\n \\n\"I won\\'t fish,\" Brett put in.\\n \\n\"Get two rods, then, and Bill won\\'t have to buy one.\"\\n \\n\"Right,\" said Mike. \"I\\'ll send a wire to the keeper.\"\\n \\n\"Won\\'t it be splendid,\" Brett said. \"Spain! We   have fun.\"\\n \\n\"The 25th. When is that?\"\\n \\n\"Saturday.\"\\n \\n\"We   have to get ready.\"\\n \\n\"I say,\" said Mike, \"I\\'m going to the barber\\'s.\"\\n \\n\"I must bathe,\" said Brett. \"Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a\\ngood chap.\"\\n \\n\"We   got the loveliest hotel,\" Mike said. \"I think it\\'s a\\nbrothel!\"\\n \\n\"We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at\\nthis hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed\\nfrightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.\"\\n \\n\"  believe it\\'s a brothel,\" Mike said. \"And   should know.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut.\"\\n \\nMike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar.\\n \\n\"Have another?\"\\n \\n\"Might.\"\\n \\n\"I needed that,\" Brett said.\\n \\nWe walked up the Rue Delambre.\\n \\n\"I haven\\'t seen you since I\\'ve been back,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"How   you, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"Fine.\"\\n \\nBrett looked at me. \"I say,\" she said, \"is Robert Cohn going on this\\ntrip?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Why?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you think it will be a bit rough on him?\"\\n \\n\"Why should it?\"\\n \\n\"Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?\"\\n \\n\"Congratulations,\" I said.\\n \\nWe walked along.\\n \\n\"What did you say that for?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. What would you like me to say?\"\\n \\nWe walked along and turned a corner.\\n \\n\"He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull.\"\\n \\n\"Does he?\"\\n \\n\"I rather thought it would be good for him.\"\\n \\n\"You might take up social service.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be nasty.\"\\n \\n\"I won\\'t.\"\\n \\n\"Didn\\'t you really know?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"I guess I didn\\'t think about it.\"\\n \\n\"Do you think it will be too rough on him?\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s up to him,\" I said. \"Tell him you\\'re coming. He can always not\\ncome.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it.\"\\n \\nI did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June.\\n \\n\"Did you hear from Cohn?\"\\n \\n\"Rather. He\\'s keen about it.\"\\n \\n\"My God!\"\\n \\n\"I thought it was rather odd myself.\"\\n \\n\"Says he can\\'t wait to see me.\"\\n \\n\"Does he think you\\'re coming alone?\"\\n \\n\"No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s wonderful.\"\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t he?\"\\n \\nThey expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona.\\nThey would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there.\\nWe would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on\\nMonday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the\\nmountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an\\nitinerary so they could follow us.\\n \\nBill and I took the morning train from the Gare d\\'Orsay. It was a lovely\\nday, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went\\nback into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked\\nthe conductor for tickets for the first service.\\n \\n\"Nothing until the fifth.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s this?\"\\n \\nThere were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and\\nalways plenty of places for both of them.\\n \\n\"They\\'re all reserved,\" the dining-car conductor said. \"There will be a\\nfifth service at three-thirty.\"\\n \\n\"This is serious,\" I said to Bill.\\n \\n\"Give him ten francs.\"\\n \\n\"Here,\" I said. \"We want to eat in the first service.\"\\n \\nThe conductor put the ten francs in his pocket.\\n \\n\"Thank you,\" he said. \"I would advise you gentlemen to get some\\nsandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at\\nthe office of the company.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll go a long way, brother,\" Bill said to him in English. \"I suppose\\nif I\\'d given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the\\ntrain.\"\\n \\n\" \"\\n \\n\"Go to hell!\" said Bill. \"Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine.\\nYou tell him, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"And send it up to the next car.\" I described where we were.\\n \\nIn our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son.\\n \\n\"I suppose you\\'re Americans, aren\\'t you?\" the man asked. \"Having a good\\ntrip?\"\\n \\n\"Wonderful,\" said Bill.\\n \\n\"That\\'s what you want to do. Travel while you\\'re young. Mother and I\\nalways wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while.\"\\n \\n\"You could have come over ten years ago, if you\\'d wanted to,\" the wife\\nsaid. \"What you always said was: \\'See America first!\\' I will say we\\'ve\\nseen a good deal, take it one way and another.\"\\n \\n\"Say, there\\'s plenty of Americans on this train,\" the husband said.\\n\"They\\'ve got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They\\'ve been on a\\npilgrimage to Rome, and now they\\'re going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.\"\\n \\n\"So, that\\'s what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"What part of the States you boys from?\"\\n \\n\"Kansas City,\" I said. \"He\\'s from Chicago.\"\\n \\n\"You both going to Biarritz?\"\\n \\n\"No. We\\'re going fishing in Spain.\"\\n \\n\"Well, I never cared for it, myself. There\\'s plenty that do out where I\\ncome from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of\\nMontana. I\\'ve been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.\"\\n \\n\"Mighty little fishing you did on them trips,\" his wife said.\\n \\nHe winked at us.\\n \\n\"You know how the ladies are. If there\\'s a jug goes along, or a case of\\nbeer, they think it\\'s hell and damnation.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s the way men are,\" his wife said to us. She smoothed her\\ncomfortable lap. \"I voted against prohibition to please him, and because\\nI like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It\\'s a\\nwonder they ever find any one to marry them.\"\\n \\n\"Say,\" said Bill, \"do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have\\ncornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?\"\\n \\n\"How do you mean? They can\\'t do a thing like that.\"\\n \\n\"You try and get seats.\"\\n \\n\"Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another\\nbreakfast.\"\\n \\nShe stood up and straightened her dress.\\n \\n\"Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.\"\\n \\nThey all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after\\nthey were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and\\npilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our\\nfriend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor\\nwith our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.\\n \\n\"You\\'re going to work to-day,\" I said.\\n \\nHe nodded his head. \"They start now, at ten-thirty.\"\\n \\n\"When do we eat?\"\\n \\n\"Huh! When do I eat?\"\\n \\nHe left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches\\nand tipped him.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll get the plates,\" he said, \"or bring them with you.\"\\n \\nWe ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out\\nof the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were\\nfull of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees,\\nand sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.\\n \\nAt Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got\\nback in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his\\nson, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.\\n \\n\"Is there good swimming in Biarritz?\" asked Hubert.\\n \\n\"That boy\\'s just crazy till he can get in the water,\" his mother said.\\n\"It\\'s pretty hard on youngsters travelling.\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s good swimming,\" I said. \"But it\\'s dangerous when it\\'s rough.\"\\n \\n\"Did you get a meal?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they\\nmust have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said\\nsomething to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.\"\\n \\n\"They thought we were snappers, all right,\" the man said. \"It certainly\\nshows you the power of the Catholic Church. It\\'s a pity you boys ain\\'t\\nCatholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.\"\\n \\n\"I am,\" I said. \"That\\'s what makes me so sore.\"\\n \\nFinally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather\\ndifficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with\\none of the returning streams of pilgrims.\\n \\n\"When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know anything about it. Haven\\'t you got tickets?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s enough to make a man join the Klan,\" Bill said. The priest looked\\nback at him.\\n \\nInside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table\\nd\\'hôte meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white\\njacket was purple under the arms.\\n \\n\"He must drink a lot of wine.\"\\n \\n\"Or wear purple undershirts.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s ask him.\"\\n \\n\"No. He\\'s too tired.\"\\n \\nThe train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through\\nthe station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town.\\nAfterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There\\nwere wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them\\nlike avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had\\ndinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It\\nwas all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings\\nwith houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got\\ndark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the\\nwindow, and about nine o\\'clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife\\nand Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to\\nchange for Biarritz.\\n \\n\"Well, I hope you have lots of luck,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Be careful about those bull-fights.\"\\n \\n\"Maybe we\\'ll see you at Biarritz,\" Hubert said.\\n \\nWe got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark\\nstation and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses.\\nThere, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see\\nus at first. Then he started forward.\\n \\n\"Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?\"\\n \\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"This is Bill Gorton.\"\\n \\n\"How are you?\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" said Robert. \"I\\'ve got a cab.\" He was a little near-sighted.\\nI had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make\\nhim out. He was shy, too.\\n \\n\"We\\'ll go up to my hotel. It\\'s all right. It\\'s quite nice.\"\\n \\nWe got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside\\nhim and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark\\nbridge and into the town.\\n \\n\"I\\'m awfully glad to meet you,\" Robert said to Bill. \"I\\'ve heard so much\\nabout you from Jake and I\\'ve read your books. Did you get my line,\\nJake?\"\\n \\nThe cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It\\nwas a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we\\neach had a good small room.\\n \\nIn the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of\\nthe town, and we all had breakfast in a café. Bayonne is a nice town. It\\nis like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so\\nearly in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We\\nwalked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.\\n \\nI was not at all sure Mike\\'s rods would come from Scotland in time, so\\nwe hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs\\nover a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had\\nto wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty\\ngood rod cheap, and two landing-nets.\\n \\nWe went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn\\nmade some remark about it being a very good example of something or\\nother, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim,\\nlike Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the\\nlocal Syndicat d\\'Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start\\nfrom. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of\\nJuly. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a\\nmotor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the\\ncorner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was\\nto pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café\\non the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot,\\nbut the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant\\nsitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that\\nthe air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the\\nhouses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the\\ncafé. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the\\nbill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went\\nup to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with\\nten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and\\nwaited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the\\nparquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed\\nhim out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just\\ncome in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.\\n \\nCohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big,\\nclosed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs,\\nand we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we\\nstarted off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely\\ngardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in\\nthe country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We\\npassed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the\\nroad, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the\\nBasque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and\\nvillages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and\\non some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on\\nthe walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against\\nthem, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the\\nroad turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close\\nalong a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back\\ntoward the sea. You couldn\\'t see the sea. It was too far away. You could\\nsee only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.\\n \\nWe crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge,\\nand Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short\\nguns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in\\nkepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in\\nand looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of\\nthe line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the\\ncar and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any\\ntrout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it\\ndid not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if\\nthere were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not\\nmany.\\n \\nI asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn\\'t care for\\nit.\\n \\nJust then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes\\nthat looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up\\nto the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on\\nhis back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.\\n \\nThe carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without\\nsaying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter with the old one?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"He hasn\\'t got any passport.\"\\n \\nI offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.\\n \\n\"What will he do?\" I asked.\\n \\nThe guard spat in the dust.\\n \\n\"Oh, he\\'ll just wade across the stream.\"\\n \\n\"Do you have much smuggling?\"\\n \\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"they go through.\"\\n \\nThe chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the\\ninside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the\\nwhite dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had\\nbeen; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road\\nwinding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There\\nwere long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of\\nbeech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit\\nof the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow\\nup, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in\\nthe road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest,\\nand there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were\\ngrassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went\\nthrough a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed\\nup and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road\\nran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to\\nthe south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.\\n \\nAfter a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along\\nboth sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the\\nroad went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little\\nrise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings\\nclose around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and\\nshifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned\\naround. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head.\\nThen we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right\\nshining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you\\ncould see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls\\nof the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of\\nthe other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every\\nway you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched\\nout white across the plain going toward Pamplona.\\n \\nWe came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road\\nslanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then\\nlevelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside\\nthe old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and\\nconcrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side\\nstreet and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.\\n \\nThe driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids\\nwatching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and\\nthe flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun\\nand under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the\\nsquare. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good\\nrooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and\\nwent down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for\\nlunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.\\n \\nThere are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the\\nsecond floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor\\nbelow the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back\\nstreet that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early\\nin the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the\\ndown-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in\\nSpain was always a shock with the hors d\\'oeuvres, an egg course, two meat\\ncourses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink\\nplenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not\\nwant any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him,\\nand so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate\\nof cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had\\nmet at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him\\nat San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not sure they\\'ll come,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"Why not?\" Bill said. \"Of course they\\'ll come.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re always late,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I rather think they\\'re not coming,\" Robert Cohn said.\\n \\nHe said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll bet you fifty pesetas they\\'re here to-night,\" Bill said. He always\\nbets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll take it,\" Cohn said. \"Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll remember it myself,\" Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to\\nsmooth him down.\\n \\n\"It\\'s a sure thing they\\'ll come,\" I said. \"But maybe not to-night.\"\\n \\n\"Want to call it off?\" Cohn asked.\\n \\n\"No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like.\"\\n \\n\"All right. I\\'ll take that.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s enough,\" I said. \"Or you\\'ll have to make a book and give me some\\nof it.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m satisfied,\" Cohn said. He smiled. \"You\\'ll probably win it back at\\nbridge, anyway.\"\\n \\n\"You haven\\'t got it yet,\" Bill said.\\n \\nWe went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Iruña for\\ncoffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.\\n \\n\"Say,\" Bill said to me, \"have I got any chance on that bet?\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ve got a rotten chance. They\\'ve never been on time anywhere. If\\ntheir money doesn\\'t come it\\'s a cinch they won\\'t get in to-night.\"\\n \\n\"I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He\\'s\\nall right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and\\nBrett fixed it up with us about coming down here.\"\\n \\nI saw Cohn coming over across the square.\\n \\n\"Here he comes.\"\\n \\n\"Well, let him not get superior and Jewish.\"\\n \\n\"The barber shop\\'s closed,\" Cohn said. \"It\\'s not open till four.\"\\n \\nWe had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking\\nout from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill\\nwent to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was\\nstill closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I\\nsat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It\\nwas very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went\\nthrough the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to\\nthe Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the\\nbull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent\\nhim from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was\\nthe archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That\\nhas nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize\\ndoor and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among\\nthe archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and\\nas I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to\\nbrush off my coat.\\n \\n\"You must have been in a motor-car,\" he said.\\n \\nThe back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray\\nwith dust.\\n \\n\"From Bayonne.\"\\n \\n\"Well, well,\" he said. \"I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the\\ndust was.\" So I gave him two copper coins.\\n \\nAt the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it.\\nThe first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked\\nit now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up,\\nand there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were\\nsome wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for\\neverybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and\\nmyself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and\\nlumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was\\npraying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the\\nbull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that\\nwe would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might\\npray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed\\nthat I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I\\nwould make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count,\\nand I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn\\'t seen\\nhim since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told\\nme about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the\\nwood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a\\nlittle ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but\\nrealized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while,\\nand maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only\\nwished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was\\nout in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers\\nand the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in\\nthe sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some\\nbuildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.\\n \\nAt dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had\\na shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair\\nafterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to\\nhelp him any. The train was due in at nine o\\'clock from San Sebastian,\\nand, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty\\nminutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from\\nthe table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with\\nhim, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave\\nhis dinner. I said we would be right back.\\n \\nWe walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn\\'s nervousness. I hoped\\nBrett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we\\nsat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen\\na man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn--nor as eager. I was\\nenjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a\\nwonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.\\n \\nAfter a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side\\nof the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We\\nwent inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of\\nthe gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started\\ncoming out through the gates.\\n \\nThey were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through\\nand out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were\\nwalking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.\\n \\n\"I knew they wouldn\\'t come,\" Robert said. We were going back to the\\nhotel.\\n \\n\"I thought they might,\" I said.\\n \\nBill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine.\\n \\n\"Didn\\'t come, eh?\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?\"\\nBill asked. \"I haven\\'t changed any money here yet.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, forget about it,\" Robert Cohn said. \"Let\\'s bet on something else.\\nCan you bet on bull-fights?\"\\n \\n\"You could,\" Bill said, \"but you don\\'t need to.\"\\n \\n\"It would be like betting on the war,\" I said. \"You don\\'t need any\\neconomic interest.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m very curious to see them,\" Robert said.\\n \\nMontoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. \"It\\'s for\\nyou.\" He handed it to me.\\n \\nIt read: \"Stopped night San Sebastian.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s from them,\" I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should\\nhave handed it over.\\n \\n\"They\\'ve stopped over in San Sebastian,\" I said. \"Send their regards to\\nyou.\"\\n \\nWhy I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know.\\nI was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact\\nthat I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly\\ndid hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that\\nlittle spell of superiority at lunch--that and when he went through all\\nthat barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to\\nme, anyway.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said. \"We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They\\ncan follow us if they get in to-morrow night.\"\\n \\nThere were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train\\nand the one we had just met.\\n \\n\"That sounds like a good idea,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"The sooner we get on the stream the better.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s all one to me when we start,\" Bill said. \"The sooner the better.\"\\n \\nWe sat in the Iruña for a while and had coffee and then took a little\\nwalk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at\\nthe edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I\\nturned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I\\nbelieve, because I was asleep when they came in.\\n \\nIn the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was\\nscheduled to leave at two o\\'clock. There was nothing earlier. I was\\nsitting over at the Iruña reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn\\ncoming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of\\nthe wicker chairs.\\n \\n\"This is a comfortable café,\" he said. \"Did you have a good night,\\nJake?\"\\n \\n\"I slept like a log.\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too.\"\\n \\n\"Where were you?\"\\n \\n\"Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café. The old man\\nthere speaks German and English.\"\\n \\n\"The Café Suizo.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it\\'s a better café\\nthan this one.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s not so good in the daytime,\" I said. \"Too hot. By the way, I got\\nthe bus tickets.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve got your ticket.\"\\n \\n\"Give it to me. I\\'ll get the money back.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s five pesetas.\"\\n \\nRobert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me.\\n \\n\"I ought to stay,\" he said. \"You see I\\'m afraid there\\'s some sort of\\nmisunderstanding.\"\\n \\n\"Why,\" I said. \"They may not come here for three or four days now if\\nthey start on parties at San Sebastian.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s just it,\" said Robert. \"I\\'m afraid they expected to meet me at\\nSan Sebastian, and that\\'s why they stopped over.\"\\n \\n\"What makes you think that?\"\\n \\n\"Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett.\"\\n \\n\"Why in hell didn\\'t you stay there and meet them then?\" I started to\\nsay, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but\\nI do not believe it ever did.\\n \\nHe was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able\\nto talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between\\nhim and Brett.\\n \\n\"Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I wish I could go. We\\'ve been looking forward to this fishing all\\nwinter.\" He was being sentimental about it. \"But I ought to stay. I\\nreally ought. As soon as they come I\\'ll bring them right up.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s find Bill.\"\\n \\n\"I want to go over to the barber-shop.\"\\n \\n\"See you at lunch.\"\\n \\nI found Bill up in his room. He was shaving.\\n \\n\"Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night,\" Bill said. \"He\\'s a great\\nlittle confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian.\"\\n \\n\"The lying bastard!\"\\n \\n\"Oh, no,\" said Bill. \"Don\\'t get sore. Don\\'t get sore at this stage of\\nthe trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t rub it in.\"\\n \\nBill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the\\nmirror while he lathered his face.\\n \\n\"Didn\\'t you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank\\nGod, I\\'m a travelling man. Haven\\'t you got some more Jewish friends you\\ncould bring along?\" He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and\\nthen started scraping again.\\n \\n\"You\\'ve got some fine ones yourself.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes. I\\'ve got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn.\\nThe funny thing is he\\'s nice, too. I like him. But he\\'s just so awful.\"\\n \\n\"He can be damn nice.\"\\n \\n\"I know it. That\\'s the terrible part.\"\\n \\nI laughed.\\n \\n\"Yes. Go on and laugh,\" said Bill. \"You weren\\'t out with him last night\\nuntil two o\\'clock.\"\\n \\n\"Was he very bad?\"\\n \\n\"Awful. What\\'s all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have\\nanything to do with him?\"\\n \\nHe raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side.\\n \\n\"Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.\"\\n \\n\"What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?\"\\n \\n\"She wanted to get out of town and she can\\'t go anywhere alone. She said\\nshe thought it would be good for him.\"\\n \\n\"What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn\\'t she go off with some of\\nher own people? Or you?\"--he slurred that over--\"or me? Why not me?\" He\\nlooked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on\\neach cheek-bone. \"It\\'s an honest face. It\\'s a face any woman would be\\nsafe with.\"\\n \\n\"She\\'d never seen it.\"\\n \\n\"She should have. All women should see it. It\\'s a face that ought to be\\nthrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a\\ncopy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their\\ndaughters about this face. My son\"--he pointed the razor at me--\"go west\\nwith this face and grow up with the country.\"\\n \\nHe ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some\\nalcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down\\nhis long upper lip.\\n \\n\"My God!\" he said, \"isn\\'t it an awful face?\"\\n \\nHe looked in the glass.\\n \\n\"And as for this Robert Cohn,\" Bill said, \"he makes me sick, and he can\\ngo to hell, and I\\'m damn glad he\\'s staying here so we won\\'t have him\\nfishing with us.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re damn right.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'re going trout-fishing. We\\'re going trout-fishing in the Irati\\nRiver, and we\\'re going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the\\ncountry, and then take a swell bus ride.\"\\n \\n\"Come on. Let\\'s go over to the Iruña and start,\" I said.\\n \\nIt was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our\\nbags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus,\\nand others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside\\nBill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a\\ncouple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was\\ncrowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top,\\nand the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot.\\nRobert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one\\nwooden seat that ran across the top.\\n \\nRobert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start. A\\nBasque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the\\nbus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the\\nwine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he\\nimitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I\\nspilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made\\nme take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it\\nfooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it.\\nThe man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not\\ngetting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man\\nwaved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at\\nlunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long\\ndrink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one\\ntook a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it\\naway. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They\\nwere peasants going up into the hills.\\n \\nFinally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert\\nCohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As\\nsoon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt\\nnice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast\\nand made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust\\npowdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through\\nthe trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The\\nBasque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the\\nwine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.\\n \\n\"Pretty nice, eh?\"\\n \\n\"These Basques are swell people,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThe Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather.\\nHe wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his\\ntanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill\\nhanded him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and\\nhanded the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand.\\nHe shoved the wine-bag up.\\n \\n\"Arriba! Arriba!\" he said. \"Lift it up.\"\\n \\nBill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into\\nhis mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the\\nleather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.\\n \\n\"No! No!\" several Basques said. \"Not like that.\" One snatched the bottle\\naway from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He\\nwas a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms\\' length and\\nraised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream\\nof wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine\\nmaking a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing\\nsmoothly and regularly.\\n \\n\"Hey!\" the owner of the bottle shouted. \"Whose wine is that?\"\\n \\nThe drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his\\neyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the\\nwine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner\\nshook the wine-skin sadly.\\n \\nWe passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the\\ndriver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside\\nthe town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming\\ncountry with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The\\ngrain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a\\nwind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose\\nunder the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into\\nthe hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only\\npatches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the\\nwater-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give\\nroom to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the\\nother, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and\\nthe mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of\\nmules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero\\ndriving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we\\npassed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky\\nand hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.\\n \\nWe came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a\\nsudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and\\nfields of grapes touched the houses.\\n \\nThe bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got\\ndown, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under\\nthe big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into\\nthe posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and\\nhay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes\\nand hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging\\nfrom the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long\\nwooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were\\nshelves stacked with supplies and goods.\\n \\nWe each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I\\ngave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the\\ncopper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.\\n \\nTwo of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they\\nbought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on\\nthe back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went\\nout into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus.\\nThere was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the\\nBasque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman\\nwho had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and\\ntalked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two\\nflat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we\\nstarted off.\\n \\nThe road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills\\nagain. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man\\nleaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English:\\n\"You\\'re Americans?\"\\n \\n\"Sure.\"\\n \\n\"I been there,\" he said. \"Forty years ago.\"\\n \\nHe was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white\\nbeard.\\n \\n\"How was it?\"\\n \\n\"What you say?\"\\n \\n\"How was America?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I was in California. It was fine.\"\\n \\n\"Why did you leave?\"\\n \\n\"What you say?\"\\n \\n\"Why did you come back here?\"\\n \\n\"Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she\\ndon\\'t like to travel. Where you from?\"\\n \\n\"Kansas City.\"\\n \\n\"I been there,\" he said. \"I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City,\\nDenver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.\"\\n \\nHe named them carefully.\\n \\n\"How long were you over?\"\\n \\n\"Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married.\"\\n \\n\"Have a drink?\"\\n \\n\"All right,\" he said. \"You can\\'t get this in America, eh?\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s plenty if you can pay for it.\"\\n \\n\"What you come over here for?\"\\n \\n\"We\\'re going to the fiesta at Pamplona.\"\\n \\n\"You like the bull-fights?\"\\n \\n\"Sure. Don\\'t you?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I guess I like them.\"\\n \\nThen after a little:\\n \\n\"Where you go now?\"\\n \\n\"Up to Burguete to fish.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I hope you catch something.\"\\n \\nHe shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other\\nBasques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me\\nwhen I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking\\nAmerican seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.\\n \\nThe bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks\\nstuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking\\nback we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were\\nsquares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the\\nbrown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the\\nhorizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see\\nother mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the\\ncrest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork\\noaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were\\ncattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the\\nroad came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a\\nrolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like\\nthe brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded\\nand there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched\\noff. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the\\ntrunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the\\nnorth. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white\\nhouses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the\\nshoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of\\nthe monastery of Roncesvalles.\\n \\n\"There\\'s Roncevaux,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Where?\"\\n \\n\"Way off there where the mountain starts.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s cold up here,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"It\\'s high,\" I said. \"It must be twelve hundred metres.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s awful cold,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThe bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to\\nBurguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The\\nhouses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no\\nside-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus\\nstopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the\\nrod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps\\ncame up.\\n \\n\"What\\'s in there?\" he pointed to the rod-case.\\n \\nI opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I\\ngot them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on.\\n \\n\"Is that all right?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Yes. Of course.\"\\n \\nWe went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families\\nsitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.\\n \\nThe fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands\\nwith us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again.\\nIt was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The\\nwoman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two\\nbeds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of\\nNuestra Señora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the\\nshutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on\\nsweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone\\nfloor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it\\nwas so cold you could see your breath.\\n \\n\"My God!\" said Bill. \"It can\\'t be this cold to-morrow. I\\'m not going to\\nwade a stream in this weather.\"\\n \\nThere was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the\\nwooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.\\n \\n\"I got to keep warm,\" he said.\\n \\nI went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board\\nwas. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.\\n \\n\"Twelve pesetas.\"\\n \\n\"Why, we only paid that in Pamplona.\"\\n \\nShe did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on\\nher apron.\\n \\n\"That\\'s too much,\" I said. \"We didn\\'t pay more than that at a big\\nhotel.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ve put in a bathroom.\"\\n \\n\"Haven\\'t you got anything cheaper?\"\\n \\n\"Not in the summer. Now is the big season.\"\\n \\nWe were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it\\'s only a few\\ndays.\\n \\n\"Is the wine included?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said. \"It\\'s all right.\"\\n \\nI went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was,\\nand went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the\\npictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of\\npheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all\\ndark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I\\nlooked at them all. Bill was still playing. \"How about a hot rum punch?\"\\nhe said. \"This isn\\'t going to keep me warm permanently.\"\\n \\nI went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it.\\nIn a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the\\nroom. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and\\nlistened to the wind.\\n \\n\"There isn\\'t too much rum in that.\"\\n \\nI went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a\\nhalf-tumblerful into the pitcher.\\n \\n\"Direct action,\" said Bill. \"It beats legislation.\"\\n \\nThe girl came in and laid the table for supper.\\n \\n\"It blows like hell up here,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThe girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We\\nhad fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of\\nwild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was\\nshy but nice about bringing it The old woman looked in once and counted\\nthe empty bottles.\\n \\nAfter supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm.\\nOnce in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be\\nwarm and in bed.\\n \\nWhen I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had\\ncleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the\\nwindow were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof\\ncracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days\\nbefore the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to\\nthe roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below\\nand when I waved at him he bounded down.\\n \\nBill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the\\nhall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring down-stairs, so I\\nunbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning\\nand the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died\\ndown. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of\\nmattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for\\nbait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On\\nthe grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and\\nloosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of\\nsight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many.\\nDigging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins\\nwith worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig.\\n \\nWhen I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I\\nasked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was\\nawake and sitting on the edge of the bed.\\n \\n\"I saw you out of the window,\" he said. \"Didn\\'t want to interrupt you.\\nWhat were you doing? Burying your money?\"\\n \\n\"You lazy bum!\"\\n \\n\"Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every\\nmorning.\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" I said. \"Get up.\"\\n \\n\"What? Get up? I never get up.\"\\n \\nHe climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.\\n \\n\"Try and argue me into getting up.\"\\n \\nI went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the\\ntackle-bag.\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t you interested?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"I\\'m going down and eat.\"\\n \\n\"Eat? Why didn\\'t you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for\\nfun. Eat? Fine. Now you\\'re reasonable. You go out and dig some more\\nworms and I\\'ll be right down.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, go to hell!\"\\n \\n\"Work for the good of all.\" Bill stepped into his underclothes. \"Show\\nirony and pity.\"\\n \\nI started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the\\nrod-case.\\n \\n\"Hey! come back!\"\\n \\nI put my head in the door.\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t you going to show a little irony and pity?\"\\n \\nI thumbed my nose.\\n \\n\"That\\'s not irony.\"\\n \\nAs I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, \"Irony and Pity. When you\\'re\\nfeeling ... Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them\\nIrony. When they\\'re feeling ... Just a little irony. Just a little\\npity ...\" He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was:\\n\"The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal.\" I was reading a week-old\\nSpanish paper.\\n \\n\"What\\'s all this irony and pity?\"\\n \\n\"What? Don\\'t you know about Irony and Pity?\"\\n \\n\"No. Who got it up?\"\\n \\n\"Everybody. They\\'re mad about it in New York. It\\'s just like the\\nFratellinis used to be.\"\\n \\nThe girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was\\nbread toasted and buttered.\\n \\n\"Ask her if she\\'s got any jam,\" Bill said. \"Be ironical with her.\"\\n \\n\"Have you got any jam?\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish.\"\\n \\nThe coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought\\nin a glass dish of raspberry jam.\\n \\n\"Thank you.\"\\n \\n\"Hey! that\\'s not the way,\" Bill said. \"Say something ironical. Make some\\ncrack about Primo de Rivera.\"\\n \\n\"I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they\\'ve gotten into in\\nthe Riff.\"\\n \\n\"Poor,\" said Bill. \"Very poor. You can\\'t do it. That\\'s all. You don\\'t\\nunderstand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful.\"\\n \\n\"Robert Cohn.\"\\n \\n\"Not so bad. That\\'s better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic.\"\\n \\nHe took a big gulp of coffee.\\n \\n\"Aw, hell!\" I said. \"It\\'s too early in the morning.\"\\n \\n\"There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You\\'re only a\\nnewspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical\\nthe minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full\\nof pity.\"\\n \\n\"Go on,\" I said. \"Who did you get this stuff from?\"\\n \\n\"Everybody. Don\\'t you read? Don\\'t you ever see anybody? You know what\\nyou are? You\\'re an expatriate. Why don\\'t you live in New York? Then\\nyou\\'d know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and\\ntell you every year?\"\\n \\n\"Take some more coffee,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Good. Coffee is good for you. It\\'s the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are\\nhere. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You\\nknow what\\'s the trouble with you? You\\'re an expatriate. One of the worst\\ntype. Haven\\'t you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country\\never wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers.\"\\n \\nHe drank the coffee.\\n \\n\"You\\'re an expatriate. You\\'ve lost touch with the soil. You get\\nprecious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to\\ndeath. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not\\nworking. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés.\"\\n \\n\"It sounds like a swell life,\" I said. \"When do I work?\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t work. One group claims women support you. Another group\\nclaims you\\'re impotent.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"I just had an accident.\"\\n \\n\"Never mention that,\" Bill said. \"That\\'s the sort of thing that can\\'t be\\nspoken of. That\\'s what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry\\'s\\nbicycle.\"\\n \\nHe had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he\\nhad hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him\\nagain.\\n \\n\"It wasn\\'t a bicycle,\" I said. \"He was riding horseback.\"\\n \\n\"I heard it was a tricycle.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said. \"A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works\\nthe same way.\"\\n \\n\"But you don\\'t pedal it.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said, \"I guess you don\\'t pedal it.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s lay off that,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle.\"\\n \\n\"I think he\\'s a good writer, too,\" Bill said. \"And you\\'re a hell of a\\ngood guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not a good guy.\"\\n \\n\"Listen. You\\'re a hell of a good guy, and I\\'m fonder of you than anybody\\non earth. I couldn\\'t tell you that in New York. It\\'d mean I was a\\nfaggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a\\nfaggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis.\\nLincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed\\nby the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel\\'s Lady and\\nJudy O\\'Grady are Lesbians under their skin.\"\\n \\nHe stopped.\\n \\n\"Want to hear some more?\"\\n \\n\"Shoot,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know any more. Tell you some more at lunch.\"\\n \\n\"Old Bill,\" I said.\\n \\n\"You bum!\"\\n \\nWe packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill\\nput it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my\\nback. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a\\npath that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of\\nthe first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The\\nfields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep\\ngrazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the\\nwoods.\\n \\nThe path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and\\nthere was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the\\nstream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the\\nrolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red\\nroofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust\\nrising.\\n \\nBeyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road\\nled down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the\\nstream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we\\nwent into the woods.\\n \\nIt was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked\\nabove the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road\\nbetween the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came\\nthrough the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big,\\nand the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no\\nundergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big\\ngray trees well spaced as though it were a park.\\n \\n\"This is country,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThe road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept\\non climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the\\ntime we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the\\ntop of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the\\nhighest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete.\\nThere were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a\\nlittle clearing in the trees.\\n \\nAhead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the\\nridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great\\nfields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees\\nand jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.\\n \\n\"We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go\\nthrough the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,\"\\nI pointed out to Bill.\\n \\n\"That\\'s a hell of a hike.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.\"\\n \\n\"Comfortably. That\\'s a nice word. We\\'ll have to go like hell to get\\nthere and back and have any fishing at all.\"\\n \\nIt was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when\\nwe came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the\\nvalley of the Rio de la Fabrica.\\n \\nThe road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead\\nwas a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field\\nof buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the\\nhillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam\\nthat crossed the river.\\n \\nBill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods,\\nput on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.\\n \\n\"You\\'re sure this thing has trout in it?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"It\\'s full of them.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s some in there.\"\\n \\n\"You going to fish bait?\"\\n \\n\"Yeah. I\\'m going to fish the dam here.\"\\n \\n\"Well, I\\'ll take the fly-book, then.\" He tied on a fly. \"Where\\'d I\\nbetter go? Up or down?\"\\n \\n\"Down is the best. They\\'re plenty up above, too.\"\\n \\nBill went down the bank.\\n \\n\"Take a worm can.\"\\n \\n\"No, I don\\'t want one. If they won\\'t take a fly I\\'ll just flick it\\naround.\"\\n \\nBill was down below watching the stream.\\n \\n\"Say,\" he called up against the noise of the dam. \"How about putting the\\nwine in that spring up the road?\"\\n \\n\"All right,\" I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream.\\nI found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road\\nto where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a\\nboard over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly\\ninto the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my\\nhand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped\\nnobody would find the wine.\\n \\nI got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and\\nlanding-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head\\nof water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the\\nsquared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river\\ntumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was\\ndeep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the\\nfalls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout\\njumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into\\nthe water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and\\ndropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the\\ndam.\\n \\nI did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt\\nthat I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost\\ndouble, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him\\nup and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against\\nthe timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into\\nmy bag.\\n \\nWhile I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I\\nbaited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the\\nsame way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same\\nsize. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same\\nway, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard\\nfrom the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked\\nout the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I\\ntook the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water\\nabove the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the\\nbag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then\\nthree more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in\\nthe ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the\\ntree.\\n \\nIt was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the\\nbag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to\\nread until Bill should come up for lunch.\\n \\nIt was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat\\nagainst the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The\\nbook was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful\\nstory about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a\\nglacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four\\nyears exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true\\nlove waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.\\n \\n\"Get any?\" he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one\\nhand, and he was sweating. I hadn\\'t heard him come up, because of the\\nnoise from the dam.\\n \\n\"Six. What did you get?\"\\n \\nBill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took\\nout three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them\\nside by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy.\\n \\n\"How are yours?\"\\n \\n\"Smaller.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s see them.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re packed.\"\\n \\n\"How big are they really?\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re all about the size of your smallest.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re not holding out on me?\"\\n \\n\"I wish I were.\"\\n \\n\"Get them all on worms?\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"You lazy bum!\"\\n \\nBill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the\\nopen bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been\\nwading the stream.\\n \\nI walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were\\ncold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I\\nspread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and\\nleaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag\\nplump with ferns.\\n \\n\"Let\\'s see that bottle,\" he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the\\nbottle and drank. \"Whew! That makes my eyes ache.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s try it.\"\\n \\nThe wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.\\n \\n\"That\\'s not such filthy wine,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"The cold helps it,\" I said.\\n \\nWe unwrapped the little parcels of lunch.\\n \\n\"Chicken.\"\\n \\n\"There\\'s hard-boiled eggs.\"\\n \\n\"Find any salt?\"\\n \\n\"First the egg,\" said Bill. \"Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see\\nthat.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.\"\\n \\n\"No. Not really?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Bryan\\'s dead.\"\\n \\nBill laid down the egg he was peeling.\\n \\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of\\nnewspaper. \"I reverse the order. For Bryan\\'s sake. As a tribute to the\\nGreat Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.\"\\n \\n\"Wonder what day God created the chicken?\"\\n \\n\"Oh,\" said Bill, sucking the drumstick, \"how should we know? We should\\nnot question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and\\nbelieve and give thanks.\"\\n \\n\"Eat an egg.\"\\n \\nBill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in\\nthe other.\\n \\n\"Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air.\\nLet us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little,\\nbrother?\"\\n \\n\"After you, brother.\"\\n \\nBill took a long drink.\\n \\n\"Utilize a little, brother,\" he handed me the bottle. \"Let us not doubt,\\nbrother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with\\nsimian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say--I want you to\\njoin with me in saying--What shall we say, brother?\" He pointed the\\ndrumstick at me and went on. \"Let me tell you. We will say, and I for\\none am proud to say--and I want you to say with me, on your knees,\\nbrother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors.\\nRemember the woods were God\\'s first temples. Let us kneel and say:\\n\\'Don\\'t eat that, Lady--that\\'s Mencken.\\'\"\\n \\n\"Here,\" I said. \"Utilize a little of this.\"\\n \\nWe uncorked the other bottle.\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" I said. \"Didn\\'t you like Bryan?\"\\n \\n\"I loved Bryan,\" said Bill. \"We were like brothers.\"\\n \\n\"Where did you know him?\"\\n \\n\"He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together.\"\\n \\n\"And Frankie Fritsch.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a lie,\" Bill said. \"I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re cock-eyed,\" I said.\\n \\n\"On wine?\"\\n \\n\"Why not?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s the humidity,\" Bill said. \"They ought to take this damn humidity\\naway.\"\\n \\n\"Have another shot.\"\\n \\n\"Is this all we\\'ve got?\"\\n \\n\"Only the two bottles.\"\\n \\n\"Do you know what you are?\" Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.\\n \\n\"No,\" I said.\\n \\n\"You\\'re in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League.\"\\n \\n\"I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a lie,\" said Bill. \"I went to Austin Business College with Wayne\\nB. Wheeler. He was class president.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"the saloon must go.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re right there, old classmate,\" Bill said. \"The saloon must go, and\\nI will take it with me.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re cock-eyed.\"\\n \\n\"On wine?\"\\n \\n\"On wine.\"\\n \\n\"Well, maybe I am.\"\\n \\n\"Want to take a nap?\"\\n \\n\"All right.\"\\n \\nWe lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees.\\n \\n\"You asleep?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" Bill said. \"I was thinking.\"\\n \\nI shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground.\\n \\n\"Say,\" Bill said, \"what about this Brett business?\"\\n \\n\"What about it?\"\\n \\n\"Were you ever in love with her?\"\\n \\n\"Sure.\"\\n \\n\"For how long?\"\\n \\n\"Off and on for a hell of a long time.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, hell!\" Bill said. \"I\\'m sorry, fella.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s all right,\" I said. \"I don\\'t give a damn any more.\"\\n \\n\"Really?\"\\n \\n\"Really. Only I\\'d a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.\"\\n \\n\"You aren\\'t sore I asked you?\"\\n \\n\"Why the hell should I be?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m going to sleep,\" Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.\\n \\n\"Listen, Jake,\" he said, \"are you really a Catholic?\"\\n \\n\"Technically.\"\\n \\n\"What does that mean?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n \\n\"All right, I\\'ll go to sleep now,\" he said. \"Don\\'t keep me awake by\\ntalking so much.\"\\n \\nI went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It\\nwas late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and\\nwent out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.\\n \\n\"What did you do? Wake up?\" Bill asked. \"Why didn\\'t you spend the\\nnight?\" I stretched and rubbed my eyes.\\n \\n\"I had a lovely dream,\" Bill said. \"I don\\'t remember what it was about,\\nbut it was a lovely dream.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t think I dreamt.\"\\n \\n\"You ought to dream,\" Bill said. \"All our biggest business men have been\\ndreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller.\\nLook at Jo Davidson.\"\\n \\nI disjointed my rod and Bill\\'s and packed them in the rod-case. I put\\nthe reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one\\nof the trout-bags in. I carried the other.\\n \\n\"Well,\" said Bill, \"have we got everything?\"\\n \\n\"The worms.\"\\n \\n\"Your worms. Put them in there.\"\\n \\nHe had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the\\noutside flap pockets.\\n \\n\"You got everything now?\"\\n \\nI looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\nWe started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to\\nBurguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the\\nroad, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows\\nlighted, to the inn.\\n \\nWe stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were\\ncold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the\\nheat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a\\ncold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the\\nbank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the\\nevenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris,\\nwho had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the\\ninn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the\\nIrati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.\\n \\nOne morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was\\nalready at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He\\nlooked up and smiled.\\n \\n\"Good morning,\" he said. \"Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they\\ngave it me with mine.\"\\n \\nThe letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup.\\nHarris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been\\nforwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:\\n \\n\"What day of the week is it?\" I asked Harris.\\n \\n\"Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses\\ntrack of the days up here in the mountains.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. We\\'ve been here nearly a week.\"\\n \\n\"I hope you\\'re not thinking of leaving?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. We\\'ll go in on the afternoon bus, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n \\n\"What a rotten business. I had hoped we\\'d all have another go at the\\nIrati together.\"\\n \\n\"We have to go   Pamplona. We\\'re meeting people there.\"\\n \\n\"What rotten luck for me. We\\'ve had a jolly time here at Burguete.\"\\n \\n\"Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there\\'s\\ngoing to be a damned fine fiesta.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'d like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I\\'d best stop on here,\\nthough. I\\'ve not much more time to fish.\"\\n \\n\"You want those big ones in the Irati.\"\\n \\n\"I say, I do, you know. They\\'re enormous trout there.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'d like to try them once more.\"\\n \\n\"Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap.\"\\n \\n\"We really have to get into town,\" I said.\\n \\n\"What a pity.\"\\n \\nAfter breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench\\nout in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the\\nroad from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a\\ntelegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.\\n \\n\"Por ustedes?\"\\n \\nI looked at it. The address was: \"Barnes, Burguete.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. It\\'s for us.\"\\n \\nShe brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of\\ncoppers. The telegram was in Spanish: \"Vengo Jueves Cohn.\"\\n \\nI handed it to Bill.\\n \\n\"What does the word Cohn mean?\" he asked.\\n \\n\"What a lousy telegram!\" I said. \"He could send ten words for the same\\nprice. \\'I come Thursday.\\' That gives you a lot of dope, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n \\n\"It gives you all the dope that\\'s of interest to Cohn.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'re going in, anyway,\" I said. \"There\\'s no use trying to move Brett\\nand Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?\"\\n \\n\"We might as well,\" said Bill. \"There\\'s no need for us to be snooty.\"\\n \\nWe walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank.\\n \\n\"What will we say?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"\\'Arriving to-night.\\' That\\'s enough.\"\\n \\nWe paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and\\nthe three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the\\nmonastery.\\n \\n\"It\\'s a remarkable place,\" Harris said, when we came out. \"But you know\\nI\\'m not much on those sort of places.\"\\n \\n\"Me either,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"It\\'s a remarkable place, though,\" Harris said. \"I wouldn\\'t not have\\nseen it. I\\'d been intending coming up each day.\"\\n \\n\"It isn\\'t the same as fishing, though, is it?\" Bill asked. He liked\\nHarris.\\n \\n\"I say not.\"\\n \\nWe were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery.\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t that a pub across the way?\" Harris asked. \"Or do my eyes deceive\\nme?\"\\n \\n\"It has the look of a pub,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"It looks to me like a pub,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I say,\" said Harris, \"let\\'s utilize it.\" He had taken up utilizing from\\nBill.\\n \\nWe had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay. He talked\\nSpanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.\\n \\n\"I say. You don\\'t know what it\\'s meant to me to have you chaps up here.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ve had a grand time, Harris.\"\\n \\nHarris was a little tight.\\n \\n\"I say. Really you don\\'t know how much it means. I\\'ve not had much fun\\nsince the war.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll fish together again, some time. Don\\'t you forget it, Harris.\"\\n \\n\"We must. We   had such a jolly good time.\"\\n \\n\"How about another bottle around?\"\\n \\n\"Jolly good idea,\" said Harris.\\n \\n\"This is mine,\" said Bill. \"Or we don\\'t drink it.\"\\n \\n\"I wish you\\'d let me pay for it. It   give me pleasure, you know.\"\\n \\n\"This is going to give me pleasure,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThe innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same\\nglasses. Harris lifted his glass.\\n \\n\"I say. You know this does utilize well.\"\\n \\nBill slapped him on the back.\\n \\n\"Good old Harris.\"\\n \\n\"I say. You know my name isn\\'t really Harris. It\\'s Wilson-Harris. All\\none name. With a hyphen, you know.\"\\n \\n\"Good old Wilson-Harris,\" Bill said. \"We call you Harris because we\\'re\\nso fond of you.\"\\n \\n\"I say, Barnes. You don\\'t know what this all means to me.\"\\n \\n\"Come on and utilize another glass,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can\\'t know. That\\'s all.\"\\n \\n\"Drink up, Harris.\"\\n \\nWe walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us.\\nWe had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us\\nhis card, with his address in London and his club and his business\\naddress, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I\\nopened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them\\nhimself. He tied all his own flies.\\n \\n\"I say, Harris--\" I began.\\n \\n\"No, no!\" he said. He was climbing down from the bus. \"They\\'re not\\nfirst-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it\\nmight remind you of what a good time we had.\"\\n \\nThe bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As\\nwe started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.\\n \\n\"Say, wasn\\'t that Harris nice?\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"I think he really did have a good time.\"\\n \\n\"Harris? You bet he did.\"\\n \\n\"I wish he\\'d come into Pamplona.\"\\n \\n\"He wanted to fish.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. You couldn\\'t tell how English would mix with each other, anyway.\"\\n \\n\"I suppose not.\"\\n \\nWe got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front\\nof the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing\\nelectric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came\\nup when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the\\npeople getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We\\nwent into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with\\nus, smiling in his embarrassed way.\\n \\n\"Your friends are here,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Mr. Campbell?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.\"\\n \\nHe smiled as though there were something I would hear about.\\n \\n\"When did they get in?\"\\n \\n\"Yesterday. I\\'ve saved you the rooms you had.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. All the rooms we looked at.\"\\n \\n\"Where are our friends now?\"\\n \\n\"I think they went to the pelota.\"\\n \\n\"And how about the bulls?\"\\n \\nMontoya smiled. \"To-night,\" he said. \"To-night at seven o\\'clock they\\nbring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go\\ndown?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes. They\\'ve never seen a desencajonada.\"\\n \\nMontoya put his hand on my shoulder.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll see you there.\"\\n \\nHe smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very\\nspecial secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very\\ndeep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were\\nsomething lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something\\nthat we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not\\nunderstand.\\n \\n\"Your friend, is he aficionado, too?\" Montoya smiled at Bill.\\n \\n\"Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.\"\\n \\n\"Yes?\" Montoya politely disbelieved. \"But he\\'s not aficionado like you.\"\\n \\nHe put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"He\\'s a real aficionado.\"\\n \\n\"But he\\'s not aficionado like you are.\"\\n \\nAficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the\\nbull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya\\'s hotel; that\\nis, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed\\nonce, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year.\\nIn Montoya\\'s room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated\\nto Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters\\nMontoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters\\nwho had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They\\noften had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean\\nanything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the\\nwaste-basket. He did not want them around.\\n \\nWe often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the\\nMontoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It\\nwas simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come\\nin from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a\\nfew minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those\\nwho were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was\\nfull. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very\\npolite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an\\nAmerican. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not\\nhave aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he\\ncould not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there\\nwas no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was\\na sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little\\non the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed\\nputting the hand on the shoulder, or a \"Buen hombre.\" But nearly always\\nthere was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch\\nyou to make it certain.\\n \\nMontoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He\\ncould forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all\\nsorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At\\nonce he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they\\nwere simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling\\nopen of the horses in bull-fighting.\\n \\nBill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and\\nchanging in his room.\\n \\n\"Well,\" he said, \"talk a lot of Spanish?\"\\n \\n\"He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s find the gang and go down.\"\\n \\n\"All right. They\\'ll probably be at the café.\"\\n \\n\"Have you got tickets?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. I got them for all the unloadings.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s it like?\" He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to\\nsee if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.\\n \\n\"It\\'s pretty good,\" I said. \"They let the bulls out of the cages one at\\na time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them\\nfrom fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run\\naround like old maids trying to quiet them down.\"\\n \\n\"Do they ever gore the steers?\"\\n \\n\"Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them.\"\\n \\n\"Can\\'t the steers do anything?\"\\n \\n\"No. They\\'re trying to make friends.\"\\n \\n\"What do they have them in for?\"\\n \\n\"To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the\\nstone walls, or goring each other.\"\\n \\n\"Must be swell being a steer.\"\\n \\nWe went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square\\ntoward the Café Iruña. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses\\nstanding in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and\\nSOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta.\\n \\nAcross the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña\\nextended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for\\nBrett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert\\nCohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was\\nbare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved.\\nHer eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.\\n \\n\"Hello, you chaps!\" she called.\\n \\nBrett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into\\nshaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.\\n \\n\"Where the hell have you been?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"I brought them up here,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"What rot,\" Brett said. \"We\\'d have gotten here earlier if you hadn\\'t\\ncome.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'d never have gotten here.\"\\n \\n\"What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill.\"\\n \\n\"Did you get good fishing?\" Mike asked. \"We wanted to join you.\"\\n \\n\"It wasn\\'t bad. We missed you.\"\\n \\n\"I wanted to come,\" Cohn said, \"but I thought I ought to bring them.\"\\n \\n\"You bring us. What rot.\"\\n \\n\"Was it really good?\" Mike asked. \"Did you take many?\"\\n \\n\"Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there.\"\\n \\n\"Named Harris,\" Bill said. \"Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war,\\ntoo.\"\\n \\n\"Fortunate fellow,\" Mike said. \"What times we had. How I wish those dear\\ndays were back.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be an ass.\"\\n \\n\"Were you in the war, Mike?\" Cohn asked.\\n \\n\"Was I not.\"\\n \\n\"He was a very distinguished soldier,\" Brett said. \"Tell them about the\\ntime your horse bolted down Piccadilly.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll not. I\\'ve told that four times.\"\\n \\n\"You never told me,\" Robert Cohn said.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.\"\\n \\n\"Tell them about your medals.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll not. That story reflects great discredit on me.\"\\n \\n\"What story\\'s that?\"\\n \\n\"Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit\\non me.\"\\n \\n\"Go on. Tell it, Brett.\"\\n \\n\"Should I?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll tell it myself.\"\\n \\n\"What medals have you got, Mike?\"\\n \\n\"I haven\\'t got any medals.\"\\n \\n\"You must have some.\"\\n \\n\"I suppose I\\'ve the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time\\nthere was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be\\nthere, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no\\nmedals, and I stopped at my tailor\\'s and he was impressed by the\\ninvitation, and I thought that\\'s a good piece of business, and I said to\\nhim: \\'You\\'ve got to fix me up with some medals.\\' He said: \\'What medals,\\nsir?\\' And I said: \\'Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.\\' So he\\nsaid: \\'What medals   you, sir?\\' And I said: \\'How should I know?\\'\\nDid he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? \\'Just give\\nme a good lot. Pick them out yourself.\\' So he got me some medals, you\\nknow, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket\\nand forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they\\'d\\nshot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn\\'t come and the King didn\\'t come,\\nand no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off\\ntheir medals, and I had mine in my pocket.\"\\n \\nHe stopped for us to laugh.\\n \\n\"Is that all?\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s all. Perhaps I didn\\'t tell it right.\"\\n \\n\"You didn\\'t,\" said Brett. \"But no matter.\"\\n \\nWe were all laughing.\\n \\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Mike. \"I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I\\ncouldn\\'t stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in\\nmy pocket. What\\'s this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut\\nthem all off their backing--you know, they put them on a strip--and gave\\nthem all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I\\nwas hell\\'s own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club.\\nDashing fellow.\"\\n \\n\"Tell the rest,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you think that was funny?\" Mike asked. We were all laughing. \"It\\nwas. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals\\nback. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had\\nleft them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell\\'s own store\\nby them.\" Mike paused. \"Rotten luck for the tailor,\" he said.\\n \\n\"You don\\'t mean it,\" Bill said. \"I should think it would have been grand\\nfor the tailor.\"\\n \\n\"Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now,\" Mike said. \"I\\nused to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he\\nwouldn\\'t send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt.\\nIt was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.\"\\n \\n\"How did you go bankrupt?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"Two ways,\" Mike said. \"Gradually and then suddenly.\"\\n \\n\"What brought it on?\"\\n \\n\"Friends,\" said Mike. \"I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had\\ncreditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.\"\\n \\n\"Tell them about in the court,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t remember,\" Mike said. \"I was just a little tight.\"\\n \\n\"Tight!\" Brett exclaimed. \"You were blind!\"\\n \\n\"Extraordinary thing,\" Mike said. \"Met my former partner the other day.\\nOffered to buy me a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Tell them about your learned counsel,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I will not,\" Mike said. \"My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this\\nis a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or\\nnot?\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go down.\"\\n \\nWe called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I\\nstarted off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her\\non the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento\\nwith the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down\\npast the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were\\nmany people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down\\nthe hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips\\nrising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we\\nturned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in\\nthe window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.\\n \\n\"That\\'s where we\\'ll go when funds get low,\" Brett said.\\n \\nThe woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we\\npassed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the\\nwindow and stared. They were staring at Brett.\\n \\nAt the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that\\nwent in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low,\\nstone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with\\napertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the\\nface of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people\\nwere climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls\\nthat separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across\\nthe grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with\\nthe bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had\\ncome by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been\\nunloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out\\nof their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name\\nand the brand of the bull-breeder.\\n \\nWe climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the\\ncorral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the\\nground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.\\n \\n\"Look up there,\" I said.\\n \\nBeyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls\\nand ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications\\nmade three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in\\nthe windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had\\nclimbed into the trees.\\n \\n\"They must think something is going to happen,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"They want to see the bulls.\"\\n \\nMike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They\\nwaved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing\\nagainst us when other people crowded them.\\n \\n\"Why don\\'t they start?\" Robert Cohn asked.\\n \\nA single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against\\nthe gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars\\ninto position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to\\npull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the\\nother end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying\\ntheir heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood\\ntogether at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull\\nwould enter.\\n \\n\"They don\\'t look happy,\" Brett said.\\n \\nThe men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the\\ncorral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.\\n \\nI leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark.\\nSome one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to\\nexplode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his\\nhorns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of\\nhorns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the\\nbull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in\\nthe straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his\\nneck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the\\ncrowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall,\\ntheir heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.\\n \\nThe bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the\\nboxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he\\nreached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man\\nhad been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick,\\nsearching drives with the right horn.\\n \\n\"My God, isn\\'t he beautiful?\" Brett said. We were looking right down on\\nhim.\\n \\n\"Look how he knows how to use his horns,\" I said. \"He\\'s got a left and a\\nright just like a boxer.\"\\n \\n\"Not really?\"\\n \\n\"You watch.\"\\n \\n\"It goes too fast.\"\\n \\n\"Wait. There\\'ll be another one in a minute.\"\\n \\nThey had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a\\nman, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and\\nwhile the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull\\ncame out into the corral.\\n \\nHe charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the\\nplanks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the\\nmen shouted: \"Hah! Hah! Toro!\" and waved their arms; the two steers\\nturned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the\\nsteers.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t look,\" I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.\\n \\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"If it doesn\\'t buck you.\"\\n \\n\"I saw it,\" she said. \"I saw him shift from his left to his right horn.\"\\n \\n\"Damn good!\"\\n \\nThe steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay\\nthe way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other\\nsteer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging,\\nwatching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked\\nhim lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the\\ncrowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him\\nand made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The\\nnext time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to\\nthe other bull.\\n \\nWhen the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer,\\nstood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the\\nnewcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him\\ndown, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been\\nunloaded the herd were all together.\\n \\nThe steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against\\nthe stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt\\nto join the herd.\\n \\nWe climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the\\nbulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all\\nquiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to\\nthe café. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on\\nthe way for several drinks.\\n \\nWe were sitting in the café.\\n \\n\"That\\'s an extraordinary business,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Will those last ones fight as well as the first?\" Robert Cohn asked.\\n\"They seemed to quiet down awfully fast.\"\\n \\n\"They all know each other,\" I said. \"They\\'re only dangerous when they\\'re\\nalone, or only two or three of them together.\"\\n \\n\"What do you mean, dangerous?\" Bill said. \"They all looked dangerous to\\nme.\"\\n \\n\"They only want to kill when they\\'re alone. Of course, if you went in\\nthere you\\'d probably detach one of them from the herd, and he\\'d be\\ndangerous.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s too complicated,\" Bill said. \"Don\\'t you ever detach me from the\\nherd, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"I say,\" Mike said, \"they   fine bulls, weren\\'t they? Did you see\\ntheir horns?\"\\n \\n\"Did I not,\" said Brett. \"I had no idea what they were like.\"\\n \\n\"Did you see the one hit that steer?\" Mike asked. \"That was\\nextraordinary.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s no life being a steer,\" Robert Cohn said.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you think so?\" Mike said. \"I would have thought you\\'d loved being\\na steer, Robert.\"\\n \\n\"What do you mean, Mike?\"\\n \\n\"They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they\\'re always\\nhanging about so.\"\\n \\nWe were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on\\ntalking.\\n \\n\"I should think you\\'d love it. You\\'d never have to say a word. Come on,\\nRobert. Do say something. Don\\'t just sit there.\"\\n \\n\"I said something, Mike. Don\\'t you remember? About the steers.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can\\'t you see we\\'re all\\nhaving a good time here?\"\\n \\n\"Come off it, Michael. You\\'re drunk,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I\\'m not drunk. I\\'m quite serious.   Robert Cohn going to follow\\nBrett around like a steer all the time?\"\\n \\n\"Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.\"\\n \\n\"Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls?\\nAren\\'t the bulls lovely? Don\\'t you like them, Bill? Why don\\'t you say\\nsomething, Robert? Don\\'t sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What\\nif Brett did sleep with you? She\\'s slept with lots of better people than\\nyou.\"\\n \\n\"Shut up,\" Cohn said. He stood up. \"Shut up, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, don\\'t stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That\\nwon\\'t make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow\\nBrett around like a poor bloody steer? Don\\'t you know you\\'re not wanted?\\nI know when I\\'m not wanted. Why don\\'t you know when you\\'re not wanted?\\nYou came down to San Sebastian where you weren\\'t wanted, and followed\\nBrett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that\\'s right?\"\\n \\n\"Shut up. You\\'re drunk.\"\\n \\n\"Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren\\'t you drunk? Why don\\'t you ever get drunk,\\nRobert? You know you didn\\'t have a good time at San Sebastian because\\nnone of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can\\'t\\nblame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn\\'t do it. You\\ncan\\'t blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?\"\\n \\n\"Go to hell, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around?\\nHaven\\'t you any manners? How do you think it makes   feel?\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re a splendid one to talk about manners,\" Brett said. \"You\\'ve such\\nlovely manners.\"\\n \\n\"Come on, Robert,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"What do you follow her around for?\"\\n \\nBill stood up and took hold of Cohn.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t go,\" Mike said. \"Robert Cohn\\'s going to buy a drink.\"\\n \\nBill went off with Cohn. Cohn\\'s face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I\\nsat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted.\\n \\n\"I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,\" she interrupted.\\n\"I\\'m not saying he\\'s not right, you know.\" She turned to me.\\n \\nThe emotion left Mike\\'s voice. We were all friends together.\\n \\n\"I\\'m not so damn drunk as I sounded,\" he said.\\n \\n\"I know you\\'re not,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"We\\'re none of us sober,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t say anything I didn\\'t mean.\"\\n \\n\"But you put it so badly,\" Brett laughed.\\n \\n\"He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well\\nwasn\\'t wanted. He hung around Brett and just   at her. It made me\\ndamned well sick.\"\\n \\n\"He did behave very badly,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Mark you. Brett\\'s had affairs with men before. She tells me all about\\neverything. She gave me this chap Cohn\\'s letters to read. I wouldn\\'t\\nread them.\"\\n \\n\"Damned noble of you.\"\\n \\n\"No, listen, Jake. Brett\\'s gone off with men. But they weren\\'t ever\\nJews, and they didn\\'t come and hang about afterward.\"\\n \\n\"Damned good chaps,\" Brett said. \"It\\'s all rot to talk about it. Michael\\nand I understand each other.\"\\n \\n\"She gave me Robert Cohn\\'s letters. I wouldn\\'t read them.\"\\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t read any letters, darling. You wouldn\\'t read mine.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t read letters,\" Mike said. \"Funny, isn\\'t it?\"\\n \\n\"You can\\'t read anything.\"\\n \\n\"No. You\\'re wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I\\'m at home.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll be writing next,\" Brett said. \"Come on, Michael. Do buck up.\\nYou\\'ve got to go through with this thing now. He\\'s here. Don\\'t spoil the\\nfiesta.\"\\n \\n\"Well, let him behave, then.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'ll behave. I\\'ll tell him.\"\\n \\n\"You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it would be nice for me to tell him.\"\\n \\n\"Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you\\nknow.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, no. I can\\'t.\"\\n \\n\"Go on. We\\'re all friends. Aren\\'t we all friends, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t tell him. It\\'s too ridiculous.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll tell him.\"\\n \\n\"You won\\'t, Michael. Don\\'t be an ass.\"\\n \\n\"He calls her Circe,\" Mike said. \"He claims she turns men into swine.\\nDamn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'d be good, you know,\" Brett said. \"He writes a good letter.\"\\n \\n\"I know,\" I said. \"He wrote me from San Sebastian.\"\\n \\n\"That was nothing,\" Brett said. \"He can write a damned amusing letter.\"\\n \\n\"She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.\"\\n \\n\"I damned well was, too.\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" I said, \"we must go in and eat.\"\\n \\n\"How should I meet Cohn?\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"Just act as though nothing had happened.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s quite all right with me,\" Mike said. \"I\\'m not embarrassed.\"\\n \\n\"If he says anything, just say you were tight.\"\\n \\n\"Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight.\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" Brett said. \"Are these poisonous things paid for? I must\\nbathe before dinner.\"\\n \\nWe walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were\\nthe lights from the cafés under the arcades. We walked across the gravel\\nunder the trees to the hotel.\\n \\nThey went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya.\\n \\n\"Well, how did you like the bulls?\" he asked.\\n \\n\"Good. They were nice bulls.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re all right\"--Montoya shook his head--\"but they\\'re not too good.\"\\n \\n\"What didn\\'t you like about them?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. They just didn\\'t give me the feeling that they were so\\ngood.\"\\n \\n\"I know what you mean.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re all right.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. They\\'re all right.\"\\n \\n\"How did your friends like them?\"\\n \\n\"Fine.\"\\n \\n\"Good,\" Montoya said.\\n \\nI went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking\\nout at the square. I stood beside him.\\n \\n\"Where\\'s Cohn?\"\\n \\n\"Up-stairs in his room.\"\\n \\n\"How does he feel?\"\\n \\n\"Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He\\'s terrible when he\\'s tight.\"\\n \\n\"He wasn\\'t so tight.\"\\n \\n\"The hell he wasn\\'t. I know what we had before we came to the café.\"\\n \\n\"He sobered up afterward.\"\\n \\n\"Good. He was terrible. I don\\'t like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was\\na silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any\\nbusiness to talk like Mike.\"\\n \\n\"How\\'d you like the bulls?\"\\n \\n\"Grand. It\\'s grand the way they bring them out.\"\\n \\n\"To-morrow come the Miuras.\"\\n \\n\"When does the fiesta start?\"\\n \\n\"Day after to-morrow.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is\\nterrible.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'d better get cleaned up for supper.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. That will be a pleasant meal.\"\\n \\n\"Won\\'t it?\"\\n \\nAs a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black,\\nsleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as\\nthough nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down.\\nHe was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but\\nhe cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to\\nmake him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so\\nlovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it.\\nThey could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was\\nMichael. They were good together.\\n \\nIt was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much\\nwine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could\\nnot prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and\\nwas happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.\\n \\nI do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on\\na bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk,\\nand when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and\\nstarted to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the\\nsame two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in \"A\\nSportsman\\'s Sketches.\" I had read it before, but it seemed quite new.\\nThe country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head\\nseemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes\\nbecause the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that\\nfeeling would pass.\\n \\nI heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night\\noutside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the\\nroom next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour\\nbefore. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them\\nlaugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not\\nnecessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the\\nwheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why\\nbecause it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is\\nlight. The hell there isn\\'t!\\n \\nI figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the\\nelectric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women,\\nanyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.\\n \\nWomen made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you\\nhad to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been\\nhaving Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it.\\nI had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the\\npresentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the\\nswell things you could count on.\\n \\nI thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays\\nand pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values.\\nYou gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for\\nsomething. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my\\nway into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either\\nyou paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances,\\nor by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money\\'s worth and\\nknowing when you had it. You could get your money\\'s worth. The world was\\na good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years,\\nI thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies\\nI\\'ve had.\\n \\nPerhaps that wasn\\'t true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did\\nlearn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to\\nknow was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you\\nlearned from that what it was all about.\\n \\nI wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a\\nbad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never\\ndrunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to\\nsee him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because\\nafterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that\\nmade you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a\\nlarge statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What\\nrot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you\\ngot into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The\\nEnglish spoken language--the upper classes, anyway--must have fewer\\nwords than the Eskimo. Of course I didn\\'t know anything about the\\nEskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn\\'t\\nknow anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with\\ninflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though.\\nI liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper\\nclasses.\\n \\nI turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that\\nnow, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too\\nmuch brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem\\nas though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was\\nanother good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward\\ndaylight I went to sleep.\\n \\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n \\nThe next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows.\\nThe town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts\\nthat were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from\\nthe corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their\\nway to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each\\ntimber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the\\ntown employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them\\nstiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big\\ngate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being\\nswept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced\\nweakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the\\nsmooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old\\nwomen sweeping out the boxes.\\n \\nOutside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the\\nentrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the\\ncrowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning\\nof the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the\\nhorse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees.\\nThe wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth\\nadvertised  . The cloth sign hung against the\\nplanks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town\\nthere was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the\\nterrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload\\npeasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the\\nbuses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags\\nfull of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray\\nmotor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and\\nthe man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the\\nstreets.\\n \\nIn the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all\\nthe good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the\\nfashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the\\nsquare while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.\\n \\nDuring the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers\\nand then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went\\nalong. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings\\nstudying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and\\nMike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was\\na quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times,\\nonce with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I\\ntold her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting\\nas it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know.\\nWe met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had\\nfollowed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went\\nfor a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.\\n \\nIt was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains.\\nIt had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the\\nplateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt\\nhealthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about\\nanything on a day like that.\\n \\nThat was the last day before the fiesta.\\n \\nAt noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no\\nother way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the\\ncountry, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice\\nthem. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The\\npeasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking,\\ngetting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the\\nplains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting\\nin values gradually. They could not start in paying café prices. They\\ngot their money\\'s worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite\\nvalue in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it\\nwould not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.\\n \\nNow on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been\\nin the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning.\\nGoing down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the\\ncathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.\\nThey were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o\\'clock mass.\\nSan Fermin is also a religious festival.\\n \\nI walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café\\non the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were\\nsitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white\\nwicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and\\nsevere folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for\\naction. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read\\nwithout asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as\\nsoon as I sat down.\\n \\n\"What are you drinking?\" I asked Bill and Robert.\\n \\n\"Sherry,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"Jerez,\" I said to the waiter.\\n \\nBefore the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the\\nfiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of\\nsmoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the\\nplaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I\\nwatched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright\\nsunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of\\nsmoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so\\nmany people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the\\nwaiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get\\nthrough the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from\\nall sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the\\ndrums coming. They were playing the   music, the pipes shrill\\nand the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.\\nWhen the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when\\nthe reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums\\ntapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd\\nyou saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.\\n \\nIn the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd\\nof children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He\\ncame out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past\\nthe café and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he\\nwent by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at\\nhim.\\n \\n\"He must be the village idiot,\" Bill said. \"My God! look at that!\"\\n \\nDown the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all\\nmen. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers.\\nThey were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen\\'s blue smocks, and\\nred handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two\\npoles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down\\nsurrounded by the crowd.\\n \\n\"Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!\" was painted on the banner.\\n \\n\"Where are the foreigners?\" Robert Cohn asked.\\n \\n\"We\\'re the foreigners,\" Bill said.\\n \\nAll the time rockets were going up. The café tables were all full now.\\nThe square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés.\\n \\n\"Where\\'s Brett and Mike?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll go and get them,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"Bring them here.\"\\n \\nThe fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days.\\nThe dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things\\nthat happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything\\nbecame quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have\\nany consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during\\nthe fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was\\nquiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the\\nsame feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven\\ndays.\\n \\nThat afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was\\ntranslated from one church to another. In the procession were all the\\ndignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the\\ncrowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced\\nthe   dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up\\nand down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the\\nclosely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were\\nthe great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King\\nand Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the  .\\n \\nThey were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the\\ndignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with\\nthe men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the\\ndwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started\\ninside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the\\nchurch, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no\\nhat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the\\nchapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping\\ntheir place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers\\nformed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths\\nof white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms\\nand put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all\\nchanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They\\nwanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the\\nsharp   they rushed us into a wine-shop.\\n \\nWe stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was\\ndark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back\\nof the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the\\nwine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.\\n \\n\"I want a leather wine-bottle,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"There\\'s a place down the street,\" I said. \"I\\'ll go get a couple.\"\\n \\nThe dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the\\nhigh wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the\\nwine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one\\ninsisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song.\\nSinging it into his ear. Beating time on Bill\\'s back.\\n \\nI explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went\\ndown the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The\\ncrowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered,\\nand I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both\\nsides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and\\nled me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.\\n \\nInside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was\\nstencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He\\ntook one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on\\nit\\n \\n\"See! It doesn\\'t leak.\"\\n \\n\"I want another one, too. A big one.\"\\n \\nHe took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof.\\nHe blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on\\nthe bota holding on to a chair.\\n \\n\"What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?\"\\n \\n\"No. Drink out of them.\"\\n \\nHe slapped me on the back.\\n \\n\"Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price.\"\\n \\nThe man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile\\nstopped.\\n \\n\"It\\'s true,\" he said. \"Eight pesetas is cheap.\"\\n \\nI paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop. It was\\ndarker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill,\\nand some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl\\nfilled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held\\nfive litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some\\none at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the\\nwine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay\\nthen bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said\\nhe would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the\\nbig five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the\\nback of his throat.\\n \\n\"All right,\" he said, and handed back the bag.\\n \\nIn the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by\\nthe dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else\\'s shoulders, and\\nthey were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in\\ntheir shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and\\nvinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar\\nwith pieces of bread.\\n \\n\"Hello, Jake. Hello!\" Mike called. \"Come here. I want you to meet my\\nfriends. We\\'re all having an hors-d\\'oeuvre.\"\\n \\nI was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names\\nto Mike and sent for a fork for me.\\n \\n\"Stop eating their dinner, Michael,\" Brett shouted from the\\nwine-barrels.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t want to eat up your meal,\" I said when some one handed me a\\nfork.\\n \\n\"Eat,\" he said. \"What do you think it\\'s here for?\"\\n \\nI unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.\\nEvery one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm\\'s length.\\n \\nOutside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession\\ngoing by.\\n \\n\"Isn\\'t that the procession?\" Mike asked.\\n \\n\"Nada,\" some one said. \"It\\'s nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle.\"\\n \\n\"Where did they find you?\" I asked Mike.\\n \\n\"Some one brought me here,\" Mike said. \"They said you were here.\"\\n \\n\"Where\\'s Cohn?\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s passed out,\" Brett called. \"They\\'ve put him away somewhere.\"\\n \\n\"Where is he?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n \\n\"How should we know,\" Bill said. \"I think he\\'s dead.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s not dead,\" Mike said. \"I know he\\'s not dead. He\\'s just passed out\\non Anis del Mono.\"\\n \\nAs he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought\\nout a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me.\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"No, thanks!\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!\"\\n \\nI took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could\\nfeel it warming in my stomach.\\n \\n\"Where the hell is Cohn?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Mike said. \"I\\'ll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?\" he\\nasked in Spanish.\\n \\n\"You want to see him?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Not me,\" said Mike. \"This gent.\"\\n \\nThe Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.\\n \\n\"Come on.\"\\n \\nIn a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It\\nwas almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat\\nand another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his\\nchest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.\\n \\n\"Let him sleep,\" the man whispered. \"He\\'s all right.\"\\n \\nTwo hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with\\nthe wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he\\ncame in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.\\n \\n\"I must have been sleeping,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Oh, not at all,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"You were only dead,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Aren\\'t we going to go and have some supper?\" Cohn asked.\\n \\n\"Do you want to eat?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Why not? I\\'m hungry.\"\\n \\n\"Eat those garlics, Robert,\" Mike said. \"I say. Do eat those garlics.\"\\n \\nCohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right.\\n \\n\"Do let\\'s go and eat,\" Brett said. \"I must get a bath.\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" Bill said. \"Let\\'s translate Brett to the hotel.\"\\n \\nWe said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and\\nwent out. Outside it was dark.\\n \\n\"What time is it do you suppose?\" Cohn asked.\\n \\n\"It\\'s to-morrow,\" Mike said. \"You\\'ve been asleep two days.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" said Cohn, \"what time is it?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s ten o\\'clock.\"\\n \\n\"What a lot we\\'ve drunk.\"\\n \\n\"You mean what a lot   drunk. You went to sleep.\"\\n \\nGoing down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up\\nin the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the\\nsquare solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.\\n \\nIt was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices\\nbeing doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After\\nthe dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would\\nstay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six\\no\\'clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around\\nfour o\\'clock. The others stayed up.\\n \\nMy own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs\\nand slept on one of the beds in Cohn\\'s room. The fiesta was going on\\noutside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When\\nI woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the\\nrelease of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would\\nrace through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping\\nheavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn\\'s and\\nwent out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the\\nbalconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the\\nstreet. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along\\nand up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men\\nrunning faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind\\nthem was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing\\ntheir heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One\\nman fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right\\non and did not notice him. They were all running together.\\n \\nAfter they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It\\nkept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had\\ngotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back\\nin the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony\\nin bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring.\\nBack in bed, I went to sleep.\\n \\nCohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and\\nclosed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just\\nacross the street were looking in.\\n \\n\"Did you see the show?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Yes. We were all there.\"\\n \\n\"Anybody get hurt?\"\\n \\n\"One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight\\npeople.\"\\n \\n\"How did Brett like it?\"\\n \\n\"It was all so sudden there wasn\\'t any time for it to bother anybody.\"\\n \\n\"I wish I\\'d been up.\"\\n \\n\"We didn\\'t know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.\"\\n \\n\"Where did you stay up?\"\\n \\n\"We danced at some club.\"\\n \\n\"I got sleepy,\" I said.\\n \\n\"My gosh! I\\'m sleepy now,\" Cohn said. \"Doesn\\'t this thing ever stop?\"\\n \\n\"Not for a week.\"\\n \\nBill opened the door and put his head in.\\n \\n\"Where were you, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?\"\\n \\n\"Grand.\"\\n \\n\"Where you going?\"\\n \\n\"To sleep.\"\\n \\nNo one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade.\\nThe town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we\\nwent over to the Iruña. It had filled up, and as the time for the\\nbull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There\\nwas a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The\\ncafé did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how\\ncrowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.\\n \\nI had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras,\\nthe first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with\\nwooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best\\nsit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill\\nand I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to\\na waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how\\nto look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of\\nbull-fights.\\n \\n\"I\\'m not worried about how I\\'ll stand it. I\\'m only afraid I may be\\nbored,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"You think so?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t look at the horses, after the bull hits them,\" I said to Brett.\\n\"Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but\\nthen don\\'t look again until the horse is dead if it\\'s been hit.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m a little nervy about it,\" Brett said. \"I\\'m worried whether I\\'ll be\\nable to go through with it all right.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll be all right. There\\'s nothing but that horse part that will\\nbother you, and they\\'re only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just\\ndon\\'t watch when it\\'s bad.\"\\n \\n\"She\\'ll be all right,\" Mike said. \"I\\'ll look after her.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t think you\\'ll be bored,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"I\\'m going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin,\" I\\nsaid. \"See you back here. Don\\'t get cock-eyed.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll come along,\" Bill said. Brett smiled at us.\\n \\nWe walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.\\n \\n\"That Cohn gets me,\" Bill said. \"He\\'s got this Jewish superiority so\\nstrong that he thinks the only emotion he\\'ll get out of the fight will\\nbe being bored.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll watch him with the glasses,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Oh, to hell with him!\"\\n \\n\"He spends a lot of time there.\"\\n \\n\"I want him to stay there.\"\\n \\nIn the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.\\n \\n\"Come on,\" said Montoya. \"Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?\"\\n \\n\"Fine,\" said Bill. \"Let\\'s go see him.\"\\n \\nWe followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.\\n \\n\"He\\'s in room number eight,\" Montoya explained. \"He\\'s getting dressed\\nfor the bull-fight.\"\\n \\nMontoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a\\nlittle light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were\\ntwo beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on.\\nThe boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes.\\nHis jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing\\nwinding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore\\na white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up\\nand stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and\\ndignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great\\naficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero\\nlistened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking\\nboy I have ever seen.\\n \\n\"You go to the bull-fight,\" he said in English.\\n \\n\"You know English,\" I said, feeling like an idiot.\\n \\n\"No,\" he answered, and smiled.\\n \\nOne of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us\\nif we spoke French. \"Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there\\nanything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?\"\\n \\nWe thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was\\nnineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three\\nhangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We\\nwished him \"Mucha suerte,\" shook hands, and went out. He was standing,\\nstraight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with\\nthe hangers-on as we shut the door.\\n \\n\"He\\'s a fine boy, don\\'t you think so?\" Montoya asked.\\n \\n\"He\\'s a good-looking kid,\" I said.\\n \\n\"He looks like a torero,\" Montoya said. \"He has the type.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s a fine boy.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll see how he is in the ring,\" Montoya said.\\n \\nWe found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my\\nroom, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went\\ndown-stairs.\\n \\nIt was a good bull-light. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro\\nRomero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had\\nkilled his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This\\nwas a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the\\nother two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But\\nthere was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was\\nmuch.\\n \\nSeveral times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and\\nCohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look\\nupset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front\\nof them.\\n \\n\"Let me take the glasses,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Does Cohn look bored?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"That kike!\"\\n \\nOutside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in\\nthe crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with\\nthe whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that\\ndisturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and\\nthe feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta\\nwas going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and\\neverywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The\\ndancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the\\nfeet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and\\ndown. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café. The waiter\\nsaved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched\\nthe crowd in the square and the dancers.\\n \\n\"What do you suppose that dance is?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"It\\'s a sort of jota.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re not all the same,\" Bill said. \"They dance differently to all\\nthe different tunes.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s swell dancing.\"\\n \\nIn front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were\\ndancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and\\nconcentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled\\nshoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels\\ntouched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and\\nthe step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.\\n \\n\"Here come the gentry,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThey were crossing the street\\n \\n\"Hello, men,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Hello, gents!\" said Brett. \"You saved us seats? How nice.\"\\n \\n\"I say,\" Mike said, \"that Romero what\\'shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, isn\\'t he lovely,\" Brett said. \"And those green trousers.\"\\n \\n\"Brett never took her eyes off them.\"\\n \\n\"I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow.\"\\n \\n\"How did it go?\"\\n \\n\"Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!\"\\n \\n\"How about the horses?\"\\n \\n\"I couldn\\'t help looking at them.\"\\n \\n\"She couldn\\'t take her eyes off them,\" Mike said. \"She\\'s an\\nextraordinary wench.\"\\n \\n\"They do have some rather awful things happen to them,\" Brett said. \"I\\ncouldn\\'t look away, though.\"\\n \\n\"Did you feel all right?\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t feel badly at all.\"\\n \\n\"Robert Cohn did,\" Mike put in. \"You were quite green, Robert.\"\\n \\n\"The first horse did bother me,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"You weren\\'t bored, were you?\" asked Bill.\\n \\nCohn laughed.\\n \\n\"No. I wasn\\'t bored. I wish you\\'d forgive me that.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s all right,\" Bill said, \"so long as you weren\\'t bored.\"\\n \\n\"He didn\\'t look bored,\" Mike said. \"I thought he was going to be sick.\"\\n \\n\"I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.\"\\n \\n\"I thought he was going to be sick. You weren\\'t bored, were you,\\nRobert?\"\\n \\n\"Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.\"\\n \\n\"He was, you know. He was positively green.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, shove it along, Michael.\"\\n \\n\"You mustn\\'t ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert,\" Mike\\nsaid. \"It might make such a mess.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, shove it along, Michael,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"He said Brett was a sadist,\" Mike said. \"Brett\\'s not a sadist. She\\'s\\njust a lovely, healthy wench.\"\\n \\n\"Are you a sadist, Brett?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Hope not.\"\\n \\n\"He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy\\nstomach.\"\\n \\n\"Won\\'t be healthy long.\"\\n \\nBill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought\\nthe absinthe glasses.\\n \\n\"Did you really like it?\" Bill asked Cohn.\\n \\n\"No, I can\\'t say I liked it. I think it\\'s a wonderful show.\"\\n \\n\"Gad, yes! What a spectacle!\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I wish they didn\\'t have the horse part,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"They\\'re not important,\" Bill said. \"After a while you never notice\\nanything disgusting.\"\\n \\n\"It is a bit strong just at the start,\" Brett said. \"There\\'s a dreadful\\nmoment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.\"\\n \\n\"The bulls were fine,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"They were very good,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"I want to sit down below, next time.\" Brett drank from her glass of\\nabsinthe.\\n \\n\"She wants to see the bull-fighters close by,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"They are something,\" Brett said. \"That Romero lad is just a child.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s a damned good-looking boy,\" I said. \"When we were up in his room I\\nnever saw a better-looking kid.\"\\n \\n\"How old do you suppose he is?\"\\n \\n\"Nineteen or twenty.\"\\n \\n\"Just imagine it.\"\\n \\nThe bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first.\\nBrett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up\\nabove. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other\\nbull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled\\ntechnicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they\\ndid not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all\\nabout. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls\\ncharged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the\\npoint of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it\\nbecame more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of\\na spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took\\nthe bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him\\nwith the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the\\nbull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his\\nbulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but\\nsmoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull,\\nand I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make\\nit look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked\\nRomero\\'s cape-work and why she did not like the others.\\n \\nRomero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and\\nnatural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their\\nelbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns\\nhad passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was\\nfaked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero\\'s bull-fighting\\ngave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his\\nmovements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close\\neach time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how\\nsomething that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it\\nwere done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito\\nall the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this\\nappearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while\\nthe bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding\\nof his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he\\ndominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he\\nprepared him for the killing.\\n \\n\"I\\'ve never seen him do an awkward thing,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"You won\\'t until he gets frightened,\" I said.\\n \\n\"He\\'ll never be frightened,\" Mike said. \"He knows too damned much.\"\\n \\n\"He knew everything when he started. The others can\\'t ever learn what he\\nwas born with.\"\\n \\n\"And God, what looks,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I believe, you know, that she\\'s falling in love with this bull-fighter\\nchap,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t be surprised.\"\\n \\n\"Be a good chap, Jake. Don\\'t tell her anything more about him. Tell her\\nhow they beat their old mothers.\"\\n \\n\"Tell me what drunks they are.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, frightful,\" Mike said. \"Drunk all day and spend all their time\\nbeating their poor old mothers.\"\\n \\n\"He looks that way,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Doesn\\'t he?\" I said.\\n \\nThey had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked,\\nthe men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke\\ninto a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a\\nswath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.\\n \\n\"This next is the last one.\"\\n \\n\"Not really,\" Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero\\nwaved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his\\nchest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.\\n \\nAfter it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.\\n \\n\"These bull-fights are hell on one,\" Brett said. \"I\\'m limp as a rag.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, you\\'ll get a drink,\" Mike said.\\n \\nThe next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very\\nbad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all\\nday and all night the fiesta kept on.\\n \\nIn the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from\\nthe sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was\\ndull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were\\nchanged. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad\\nweather was coming over the mountains from the sea.\\n \\nThe flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners\\nwere wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between\\nthe steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the\\narcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and\\ndark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only\\ndriven under cover.\\n \\nThe covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting\\nout of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers\\nand singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes\\ndanced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp,\\nand the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed\\nhorses, their costumes wet, the horses\\' coats wet in the rain. The crowd\\nwas in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their\\ntight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their\\nbelled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs\\nto dry. It was raining hard outside.\\n \\nI left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved\\nfor dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.\\n \\n\"Come in,\" I called.\\n \\nMontoya walked in.\\n \\n\"How are you?\" he said.\\n \\n\"Fine,\" I said.\\n \\n\"No bulls to-day.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said, \"nothing but rain.\"\\n \\n\"Where are your friends?\"\\n \\n\"Over at the Iruña.\"\\n \\nMontoya smiled his embarrassed smile.\\n \\n\"Look,\" he said. \"Do you know the American ambassador?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Everybody knows the American ambassador.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s here in town, now.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Everybody\\'s seen them.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve seen them, too,\" Montoya said. He didn\\'t say anything. I went on\\nshaving.\\n \\n\"Sit down,\" I said. \"Let me send for a drink.\"\\n \\n\"No, I have to go.\"\\n \\nI finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with\\ncold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.\\n \\n\"Look,\" he said. \"I\\'ve just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel\\nthat they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee\\nto-night after dinner.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it can\\'t hurt Marcial any.\"\\n \\n\"Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this\\nmorning with Marquez. I don\\'t think they\\'ll be back to-night.\"\\n \\nMontoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t give Romero the message,\" I said.\\n \\n\"You think so?\"\\n \\n\"Absolutely.\"\\n \\nMontoya was very pleased.\\n \\n\"I wanted to ask you because you were an American,\" he said.\\n \\n\"That\\'s what I\\'d do.\"\\n \\n\"Look,\" said Montoya. \"People take a boy like that. They don\\'t know what\\nhe\\'s worth. They don\\'t know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter\\nhim. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they\\'re\\nthrough.\"\\n \\n\"Like Algabeno,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Yes, like Algabeno.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re a fine lot,\" I said. \"There\\'s one American woman down here now\\nthat collects bull-fighters.\"\\n \\n\"I know. They only want the young ones.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"The old ones get fat.\"\\n \\n\"Or crazy like Gallo.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it\\'s easy. All you have to do is not give him the\\nmessage.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s such a fine boy,\" said Montoya. \"He ought to stay with his own\\npeople. He shouldn\\'t mix in that stuff.\"\\n \\n\"Won\\'t you have a drink?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"No,\" said Montoya, \"I have to go.\" He went out.\\n \\nI went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the\\narcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the\\nIruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the\\nsquare and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs\\ndining-room.\\n \\nThey were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill\\nwas buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and\\neach one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.\\n \\n\"This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished,\" Mike said. \"I\\nsay, Bill is an ass.\"\\n \\nThe bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.\\n \\n\"Limpia botas?\" he said to Bill.\\n \\n\"No,\" said Bill. \"For this Señor.\"\\n \\nThe bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike\\'s\\nfree shoe that shone already in the electric light.\\n \\n\"Bill\\'s a yell of laughter,\" Mike said.\\n \\nI was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little\\nuncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At\\nthe next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me\\nto come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost\\ntouching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man\\nwith a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was\\nvery pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I\\nreached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm.\\nRomero laughed.\\n \\n\"Drink here,\" he said in English.\\n \\nHe was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased\\nwith it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure\\nof, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for\\n , the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious\\nof. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the   of a  .\\nThe Spanish word   means in English the running of bulls--the\\nFrench translation is  . The critic put that in.\\nThere is no Spanish word for bull-fight.\\n \\nPedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was\\nborn in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting\\nin Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it\\nthree years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of\\n  expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His\\nolder brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in\\nthis hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked\\nfor Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I\\ntold him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to\\nexplain after I had made the mistake.\\n \\n\"Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid\\nin the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.\\n \\n\"The first or the second time?\"\\n \\n\"The first.\"\\n \\n\"I was very bad,\" he said. \"The second time I was better. You remember?\"\\nHe turned to the critic.\\n \\nHe was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something\\naltogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly\\nabout him.\\n \\n\"I like it very much that you like my work,\" he said. \"But you haven\\'t\\nseen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to\\nyou.\"\\n \\nWhen he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic\\nnor I would think he was boasting.\\n \\n\"I am anxious to see it,\" the critic said. \"I would like to be\\nconvinced.\"\\n \\n\"He doesn\\'t like my work much.\" Romero turned to me. He was serious.\\n \\nThe critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had\\nbeen incomplete.\\n \\n\"Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.\"\\n \\n\"Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?\" the critic asked me.\\n \\n\"Yes. I saw them unloaded.\"\\n \\nPedro Romero leaned forward.\\n \\n\"What did you think of them?\"\\n \\n\"Very nice,\" I said. \"About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns.\\nHaven\\'t you seen them?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Romero.\\n \\n\"They won\\'t weigh twenty-six arrobas,\" said the critic.\\n \\n\"No,\" said Romero.\\n \\n\"They\\'ve got bananas for horns,\" the critic said.\\n \\n\"You call them bananas?\" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled.\\n\"  wouldn\\'t call them bananas?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"They\\'re horns all right.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re very short,\" said Pedro Romero. \"Very, very short. Still, they\\naren\\'t bananas.\"\\n \\n\"I say, Jake,\" Brett called from the next table, \"you   deserted\\nus.\"\\n \\n\"Just temporarily,\" I said. \"We\\'re talking bulls.\"\\n \\n\"You   superior.\"\\n \\n\"Tell him that bulls have no balls,\" Mike shouted. He was drunk.\\n \\nRomero looked at me inquiringly.\\n \\n\"Drunk,\" I said. \"Borracho! Muy borracho!\"\\n \\n\"You might introduce your friends,\" Brett said. She had not stopped\\nlooking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee\\nwith us. They both stood up. Romero\\'s face was very brown. He had very\\nnice manners.\\n \\nI introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was\\nnot enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to\\nhave coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for\\neverybody. There was a lot of drunken talking.\\n \\n\"Tell him I think writing is lousy,\" Bill said. \"Go on, tell him. Tell\\nhim I\\'m ashamed of being a writer.\"\\n \\nPedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.\\n \\n\"Go on. Tell him!\" Bill said.\\n \\nRomero looked up smiling.\\n \\n\"This gentleman,\" I said, \"is a writer.\"\\n \\nRomero was impressed. \"This other one, too,\" I said, pointing at Cohn.\\n \\n\"He looks like Villalta,\" Romero said, looking at Bill. \"Rafael, doesn\\'t\\nhe look like Villalta?\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t see it,\" the critic said.\\n \\n\"Really,\" Romero said in Spanish. \"He looks a lot like Villalta. What\\ndoes the drunken one do?\"\\n \\n\"Nothing.\"\\n \\n\"Is that why he drinks?\"\\n \\n\"No. He\\'s waiting to marry this lady.\"\\n \\n\"Tell him bulls have no balls!\" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other\\nend of the table.\\n \\n\"What does he say?\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s drunk.\"\\n \\n\"Jake,\" Mike called. \"Tell him bulls have no balls!\"\\n \\n\"You understand?\" I said.\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\nI was sure he didn\\'t, so it was all right.\\n \\n\"Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants.\"\\n \\n\"Pipe down, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants.\"\\n \\n\"Pipe down.\"\\n \\nDuring this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett\\nwas talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and\\nlaughing.\\n \\nBill was filling the glasses.\\n \\n\"Tell him Brett wants to come into----\"\\n \\n\"Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ\\'s sake!\"\\n \\nRomero looked up smiling. \"Pipe down! I know that,\" he said.\\n \\nJust then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he\\nsaw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting\\nlaughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of\\ndrunks. He did not even nod.\\n \\nMontoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast.\\n\"Let\\'s all drink to--\" he began. \"Pedro Romero,\" I said. Everybody stood\\nup. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it\\ndown, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear\\nthat that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off\\nall right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the\\ncritic went out together.\\n \\n\"My God! he\\'s a lovely boy,\" Brett said. \"And how I would love to see\\nhim get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.\"\\n \\n\"I started to tell him,\" Mike began. \"And Jake kept interrupting me. Why\\ndo you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you.\"\\n \\n\"No, I\\'d like to get this settled.\" He turned away from me. \"Do you\\nthink you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among\\nus? People who are out to have a good time? For God\\'s sake don\\'t be so\\nnoisy, Cohn!\"\\n \\n\"Oh, cut it out, Mike,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party?\\nWhy don\\'t you say something?\"\\n \\n\"I said all I had to say the other night, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not one of you literary chaps.\" Mike stood shakily and leaned\\nagainst the table. \"I\\'m not clever. But I do know when I\\'m not wanted.\\nWhy don\\'t you see when you\\'re not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for\\nGod\\'s sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don\\'t you think I\\'m right?\"\\n \\nHe looked at us.\\n \\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"Let\\'s all go over to the Iruña.\"\\n \\n\"No. Don\\'t you think I\\'m right? I love that woman.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, don\\'t start that again. Do shove it along, Michael,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you think I\\'m right, Jake?\"\\n \\nCohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got\\nwhen he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The\\nchildish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.\\n \\n\"Jake,\" Mike said. He was almost crying. \"You know I\\'m right. Listen,\\nyou!\" He turned to Cohn: \"Go away! Go away now!\"\\n \\n\"But I won\\'t go, Mike,\" said Cohn.\\n \\n\"Then I\\'ll make you!\" Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn\\nstood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow,\\nhis hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready\\nto do battle for his lady love.\\n \\nI grabbed Mike. \"Come on to the café,\" I said. \"You can\\'t hit him here\\nin the hotel.\"\\n \\n\"Good!\" said Mike. \"Good idea!\"\\n \\nWe started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw\\nCohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring\\nanother glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at\\nnothing.\\n \\nOutside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to\\nget through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was\\nplaying and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the\\nfireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A\\nballoon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind\\nor blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The\\nmagnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the\\ncrowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.\\n \\nBrett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and\\nwatched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little\\nplatform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above\\nthe heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The\\nwind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito\\'s face was sweaty in\\nthe light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and\\ncharged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the\\npeople. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened,\\ncaught fire, and fell.\\n \\n\"They\\'re razzing Don Manuel,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"How do you know he\\'s Don Manuel?\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"His name\\'s on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of\\nesta ciudad.\"\\n \\n\"Globos illuminados,\" Mike said. \"A collection of globos illuminados.\\nThat\\'s what the paper said.\"\\n \\nThe wind blew the band music away.\\n \\n\"I say, I wish one would go up,\" Brett said. \"That Don Manuel chap is\\nfurious.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out\\n\\'Hail to San Fermin,\\'\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Globos illuminados,\" Mike said. \"A bunch of bloody globos illuminados.\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" said Brett. \"We can\\'t stand here.\"\\n \\n\"Her ladyship wants a drink,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"How you know things,\" Brett said.\\n \\nInside, the café was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in.\\nWe could not find a table. There was a great noise going on.\\n \\n\"Come on, let\\'s get out of here,\" Bill said.\\n \\nOutside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English\\nand Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables.\\nSome of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had\\nacquired, at some time, a friend of Bill\\'s from Biarritz. She was\\nstaying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a\\nheadache and had gone to bed.\\n \\n\"Here\\'s the pub,\" Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar\\nwhere you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all\\nsat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not\\nfull. There was nothing going on.\\n \\n\"This is a hell of a place,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"It\\'s too early.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s take the bottle and come back later,\" Bill said. \"I don\\'t want to\\nsit here on a night like this.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go and look at the English,\" Mike said. \"I love to look at the\\nEnglish.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re awful,\" Bill said. \"Where did they all come from?\"\\n \\n\"They come from Biarritz,\" Mike said, \"They come to see the last day of\\nthe quaint little Spanish fiesta.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll festa them,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"You\\'re an extraordinarily beautiful girl.\" Mike turned to Bill\\'s\\nfriend. \"When did you come here?\"\\n \\n\"Come off it, Michael.\"\\n \\n\"I say, she   a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been\\nlooking all this while? You\\'re a lovely thing.   we met? Come along\\nwith me and Bill. We\\'re going to festa the English.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll festa them,\" Bill said, \"What the hell are they doing at this\\nfiesta?\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" Mike said. \"Just us three. We\\'re going to festa the bloody\\nEnglish. I hope you\\'re not English? I\\'m Scotch. I hate the English. I\\'m\\ngoing to festa them. Come on, Bill.\"\\n \\nThrough the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the\\ncafé. Rockets were going up in the square.\\n \\n\"I\\'m going to sit here,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll stay with you,\" Cohn said.\\n \\n\"Oh, don\\'t!\" Brett said. \"For God\\'s sake, go off somewhere. Can\\'t you\\nsee Jake and I want to talk?\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t,\" Cohn said. \"I thought I\\'d sit here because I felt a little\\ntight.\"\\n \\n\"What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you\\'re tight, go\\nto bed. Go on to bed.\"\\n \\n\"Was I rude enough to him?\" Brett asked. Cohn was gone. \"My God! I\\'m so\\nsick of him!\"\\n \\n\"He doesn\\'t add much to the gayety.\"\\n \\n\"He depresses me so.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s behaved very badly.\"\\n \\n\"Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s probably waiting just outside the door now.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can\\'t believe it\\ndidn\\'t mean anything.\"\\n \\n\"I know.\"\\n \\n\"Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I\\'m so sick of the whole thing.\\nAnd Michael. Michael\\'s been lovely, too.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s been damned hard on Mike.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. But he didn\\'t need to be a swine.\"\\n \\n\"Everybody behaves badly,\" I said. \"Give them the proper chance.\"\\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t behave badly.\" Brett looked at me.\\n \\n\"I\\'d be as big an ass as Cohn,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Darling, don\\'t let\\'s talk a lot of rot.\"\\n \\n\"All right. Talk about anything you like.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be difficult. You\\'re the only person I\\'ve got, and I feel rather\\nawful to-night.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ve got Mike.\"\\n \\n\"Yes, Mike. Hasn\\'t he been pretty?\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it\\'s been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and\\nseeing him with you.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t I know it, darling? Please don\\'t make me feel any worse than I\\ndo.\"\\n \\nBrett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away\\nfrom me and looking ahead at the wall.\\n \\n\"Want to go for a walk?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Come on.\"\\n \\nI corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender.\\n \\n\"Let\\'s have one more drink of that,\" Brett said. \"My nerves are rotten.\"\\n \\nWe each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy.\\n \\n\"Come on,\" said Brett.\\n \\nAs we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.\\n \\n\"He   there,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"He can\\'t be away from you.\"\\n \\n\"Poor devil!\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.\"\\n \\n\"I hate him, too,\" she shivered. \"I hate his damned suffering.\"\\n \\nWe walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the\\nlights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along\\nit to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with\\nlight coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden\\nbursts of music.\\n \\n\"Want to go in?\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\nWe walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the\\nfortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down.\\nAcross the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind\\nwas high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark\\npits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the\\ncathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t feel bad,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I feel like hell,\" Brett said. \"Don\\'t let\\'s talk.\"\\n \\nWe looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the\\nmoonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the\\nmountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort.\\nBelow to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black\\nand smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out.\\nBrett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered.\\n \\n\"It\\'s cold.\"\\n \\n\"Want to walk back?\"\\n \\n\"Through the park.\"\\n \\nWe climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark\\nunder the trees.\\n \\n\"Do you still love me, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Because I\\'m a goner,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"How?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m a goner. I\\'m mad about the Romero boy. I\\'m in love with him, I\\nthink.\"\\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t be if I were you.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t help it. I\\'m a goner. It\\'s tearing me all up inside.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t do it.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t help it. I\\'ve never been able to help anything.\"\\n \\n\"You ought to stop it.\"\\n \\n\"How can I stop it? I can\\'t stop things. Feel that?\"\\n \\nHer hand was trembling.\\n \\n\"I\\'m like that all through.\"\\n \\n\"You oughtn\\'t to do it.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t help it. I\\'m a goner now, anyway. Don\\'t you see the\\ndifference?\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve got to do something. I\\'ve got to do something I really want to do.\\nI\\'ve lost my self-respect.\"\\n \\n\"You don\\'t have to do that.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, darling, don\\'t be difficult. What do you think it\\'s meant to have\\nthat damned Jew about, and Mike the way he\\'s acted?\"\\n \\n\"Sure.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t just stay tight all the time.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through\\nthis.\"\\n \\n\"Sure.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t say it\\'s right. It is right though for me. God knows, I\\'ve\\nnever felt such a bitch.\"\\n \\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\\n \\n\"Come on,\" Brett said. \"Let\\'s go and find him.\"\\n \\nTogether we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under\\nthe trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the\\nstreet that led into town.\\n \\nPedro Romero was in the café. He was at a table with other bull-fighters\\nand bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they\\nlooked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down\\nthe room.\\n \\n\"Ask him to come over and have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Not yet. He\\'ll come over.\"\\n \\n\"I can\\'t look at him.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s nice to look at,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I\\'ve always done just what I wanted.\"\\n \\n\"I know.\"\\n \\n\"I do feel such a bitch.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said.\\n \\n\"My God!\" said Brett, \"the things a woman goes through.\"\\n \\n\"Yes?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I do feel such a bitch.\"\\n \\nI looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to\\nthe other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table.\\nI stood up and we shook hands.\\n \\n\"Won\\'t you have a drink?\"\\n \\n\"You must have a drink with me,\" he said. He seated himself, asking\\nBrett\\'s permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners.\\nBut he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face.\\n \\n\"You like cigars?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars.\"\\n \\nIt was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I\\nnoticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a\\ntriangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt\\nthere was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave\\nhim her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did\\nnot want to make any mistake.\\n \\n\"You fight to-morrow?\" I said.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said. \"Badly?\"\\n \\nHe shook his head.\\n \\n\"Nothing. Here,\" he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the\\nfingers apart.\\n \\n\"Oh!\" he said in English, \"you tell fortunes?\"\\n \\n\"Sometimes. Do you mind?\"\\n \\n\"No. I like it.\" He spread his hand flat on the table. \"Tell me I live\\nfor always, and be a millionaire.\"\\n \\nHe was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. \"Look,\" he said,\\n\"do you see any bulls in my hand?\"\\n \\nHe laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.\\n \\n\"There are thousands of bulls,\" Brett said. She was not at all nervous\\nnow. She looked lovely.\\n \\n\"Good,\" Romero laughed. \"At a thousand duros apiece,\" he said to me in\\nSpanish. \"Tell me some more.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s a good hand,\" Brett said. \"I think he\\'ll live a long time.\"\\n \\n\"Say it to me. Not to your friend.\"\\n \\n\"I said you\\'d live a long time.\"\\n \\n\"I know it,\" Romero said. \"I\\'m never going to die.\"\\n \\nI tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his\\nhead.\\n \\n\"No. Don\\'t do that. The bulls are my best friends.\"\\n \\nI translated to Brett.\\n \\n\"You kill your friends?\" she asked.\\n \\n\"Always,\" he said in English, and laughed. \"So they don\\'t kill me.\" He\\nlooked at her across the table.\\n \\n\"You know English well.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody\\nknow. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English.\"\\n \\n\"Why?\" asked Brett.\\n \\n\"It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.\"\\n \\n\"Why not?\"\\n \\n\"They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that.\"\\n \\n\"What are bull-fighters like?\"\\n \\nHe laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle\\nof his cigar and the expression of his face.\\n \\n\"Like at the table,\" he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly\\nthe expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. \"No. I\\nmust forget English.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t forget it, yet,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"No?\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"All right.\"\\n \\nHe laughed again.\\n \\n\"I would like a hat like that,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Good. I\\'ll get you one.\"\\n \\n\"Right. See that you do.\"\\n \\n\"I will. I\\'ll get you one to-night.\"\\n \\nI stood up. Romero rose, too.\\n \\n\"Sit down,\" I said. \"I must go and find our friends and bring them\\nhere.\"\\n \\nHe looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It\\nwas understood all right.\\n \\n\"Sit down,\" Brett said to him. \"You must teach me Spanish.\"\\n \\nHe sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The\\nhard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not\\npleasant. When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later,\\nBrett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty\\ncognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked\\nup the glasses and mopped off the table.\\n \\nOutside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the\\ngirl\\'s name.\\n \\n\"We\\'ve been thrown out,\" Edna said.\\n \\n\"By the police,\" said Mike. \"There\\'s some people in there that don\\'t\\nlike me.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve kept them out of four fights,\" Edna said. \"You\\'ve got to help me.\"\\n \\nBill\\'s face was red.\\n \\n\"Come back in, Edna,\" he said. \"Go on in there and dance with Mike.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s silly,\" Edna said. \"There\\'ll just be another row.\"\\n \\n\"Damned Biarritz swine,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Come on,\" Mike said. \"After all, it\\'s a pub. They can\\'t occupy a whole\\npub.\"\\n \\n\"Good old Mike,\" Bill said. \"Damned English swine come here and insult\\nMike and try and spoil the fiesta.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re so bloody,\" Mike said. \"I hate the English.\"\\n \\n\"They can\\'t insult Mike,\" Bill said. \"Mike is a swell fellow. They can\\'t\\ninsult Mike. I won\\'t stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?\" His\\nvoice broke.\\n \\n\"Who cares?\" Mike said. \"I don\\'t care. Jake doesn\\'t care. Do  \\ncare?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" Edna said. \"Are you a bankrupt?\"\\n \\n\"Of course I am. You don\\'t care, do you, Bill?\"\\n \\nBill put his arm around Mike\\'s shoulder.\\n \\n\"I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I\\'d show those bastards.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re just English,\" Mike said. \"It never makes any difference what\\nthe English say.\"\\n \\n\"The dirty swine,\" Bill said. \"I\\'m going to clean them out.\"\\n \\n\"Bill,\" Edna looked at me. \"Please don\\'t go in again, Bill. They\\'re so\\nstupid.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Mike. \"They\\'re stupid. I knew that was what it was.\"\\n \\n\"They can\\'t say things like that about Mike,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Do you know them?\" I asked Mike.\\n \\n\"No. I never saw them. They say they know me.\"\\n \\n\"I won\\'t stand it,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Come on. Let\\'s go over to the Suizo,\" I said.\\n \\n\"They\\'re a bunch of Edna\\'s friends from Biarritz,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"They\\'re simply stupid,\" Edna said.\\n \\n\"One of them\\'s Charley Blackman, from Chicago,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"I was never in Chicago,\" Mike said.\\n \\nEdna started to laugh and could not stop.\\n \\n\"Take me away from here,\" she said, \"you bankrupts.\"\\n \\n\"What kind of a row was it?\" I asked Edna. We were walking across the\\nsquare to the Suizo. Bill was gone.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep\\nMike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at\\nCannes. What\\'s the matter with Mike?\"\\n \\n\"Probably he owes them money\" I said. \"That\\'s what people usually get\\nbitter about.\"\\n \\nIn front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of\\npeople waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground\\nwith blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the\\nwickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The\\nnight was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line\\nwere sleeping.\\n \\nAt the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert\\nCohn came up.\\n \\n\"Where\\'s Brett?\" he asked.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n \\n\"She was with you.\"\\n \\n\"She must have gone to bed.\"\\n \\n\"She\\'s not.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know where she is.\"\\n \\nHis face was sallow under the light. He was standing up.\\n \\n\"Tell me where she is.\"\\n \\n\"Sit down,\" I said. \"I don\\'t know where she is.\"\\n \\n\"The hell you don\\'t!\"\\n \\n\"You can shut your face.\"\\n \\n\"Tell me where Brett is.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll not tell you a damn thing.\"\\n \\n\"You know where she is.\"\\n \\n\"If I did I wouldn\\'t tell you.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, go to hell, Cohn,\" Mike called from the table. \"Brett\\'s gone off\\nwith the bull-fighter chap. They\\'re on their honeymoon.\"\\n \\n\"You shut up.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, go to hell!\" Mike said languidly.\\n \\n\"Is that where she is?\" Cohn turned to me.\\n \\n\"Go to hell!\"\\n \\n\"She was with you. Is that where she is?\"\\n \\n\"Go to hell!\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll make you tell me\"--he stepped forward--\"you damned pimp.\"\\n \\nI swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light.\\nHe hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet\\nhe hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up\\nand felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try\\nand hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my\\nhead. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair.\\nMike was pulling at my ears.\\n \\n\"I say, you were cold,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"Where the hell were you?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, I was around.\"\\n \\n\"You didn\\'t want to mix in it?\"\\n \\n\"He knocked Mike down, too,\" Edna said.\\n \\n\"He didn\\'t knock me out,\" Mike said. \"I just lay there.\"\\n \\n\"Does this happen every night at your fiestas?\" Edna asked. \"Wasn\\'t that\\nMr. Cohn?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m all right,\" I said. \"My head\\'s a little wobbly.\"\\n \\nThere were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around.\\n \\n\"Vaya!\" said Mike. \"Get away. Go on.\"\\n \\nThe waiters moved the people away.\\n \\n\"It was quite a thing to watch,\" Edna said. \"He must be a boxer.\"\\n \\n\"He is.\"\\n \\n\"I wish Bill had been here,\" Edna said. \"I\\'d like to have seen Bill\\nknocked down, too. I\\'ve always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He\\'s so\\nbig.\"\\n \\n\"I was hoping he would knock down a waiter,\" Mike said, \"and get\\narrested. I\\'d like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Oh, no,\" said Edna. \"You don\\'t mean that.\"\\n \\n\"I do, though,\" Mike said. \"I\\'m not one of these chaps likes being\\nknocked about. I never play games, even.\"\\n \\nMike took a drink.\\n \\n\"I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having\\na horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"All right.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re nice,\" Edna said to Mike. \"Are you really a bankrupt?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m a tremendous bankrupt,\" Mike said. \"I owe money to everybody. Don\\'t\\nyou owe any money?\"\\n \\n\"Tons.\"\\n \\n\"I owe everybody money,\" Mike said. \"I borrowed a hundred pesetas from\\nMontoya to-night.\"\\n \\n\"The hell you did,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll pay it back,\" Mike said. \"I always pay everything back.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s why you\\'re a bankrupt, isn\\'t it?\" Edna said.\\n \\nI stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed\\nlike some bad play.\\n \\n\"I\\'m going over to the hotel,\" I said. Then I heard them talking about\\nme.\\n \\n\"Is he all right?\" Edna asked.\\n \\n\"We\\'d better walk with him.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m all right,\" I said. \"Don\\'t come. I\\'ll see you all later.\"\\n \\nI walked away from the café. They were sitting at the table. I looked\\nback at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one\\nof the tables with his head in his hands.\\n \\nWalking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and\\nchanged. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the\\nflagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I\\nfelt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was\\ncarrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the\\nstreet from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it\\nwas all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road,\\nand I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I\\nwent on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed\\nto come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great\\ndistance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was\\nlike that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in\\nthe hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling\\nthat I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill\\ncame out and met me in the hall.\\n \\n\"Say,\" he said, \"go up and see Cohn. He\\'s been in a jam, and he\\'s asking\\nfor you.\"\\n \\n\"The hell with him.\"\\n \\n\"Go on. Go on up and see him.\"\\n \\nI did not want to climb another flight of stairs.\\n \\n\"What are you looking at me that way for?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He\\'s in bad shape.\"\\n \\n\"You were drunk a little while ago,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I\\'m drunk now,\" Bill said. \"But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see\\nyou.\"\\n \\n\"All right,\" I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I\\nwent on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the\\nhall to Cohn\\'s room. The door was shut and I knocked.\\n \\n\"Who is it?\"\\n \\n\"Barnes.\"\\n \\n\"Come in, Jake.\"\\n \\nI opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no\\nlight in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.\\n \\n\"Hello, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t call me Jake.\"\\n \\nI stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it\\nwas a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.\\n \\n\"Where\\'s the bathroom?\" I asked.\\n \\nCohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying. He had on a\\nwhite polo shirt, the kind he\\'d worn at Princeton.\\n \\n\"I\\'m sorry, Jake. Please forgive me.\"\\n \\n\"Forgive you, hell.\"\\n \\n\"Please forgive me, Jake.\"\\n \\nI did not say anything. I stood there by the door.\\n \\n\"I was crazy. You must see how it was.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right.\"\\n \\n\"I couldn\\'t stand it about Brett.\"\\n \\n\"You called me a pimp.\"\\n \\nI did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water.\\n \\n\"I know. Please don\\'t remember it. I was crazy.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s all right.\"\\n \\nHe was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on\\nthe bed in the dark. His polo shirt.\\n \\n\"I\\'m going away in the morning.\"\\n \\nHe was crying without making any noise.\\n \\n\"I just couldn\\'t stand it about Brett. I\\'ve been through hell, Jake.\\nIt\\'s been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as\\nthough I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn\\'t stand it. We lived\\ntogether at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can\\'t stand it any\\nmore.\"\\n \\nHe lay there on the bed.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I\\'m going to take a bath.\"\\n \\n\"You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"so long.\"\\n \\n\"I guess it isn\\'t any use,\" he said. \"I guess it isn\\'t any damn use.\"\\n \\n\"What?\"\\n \\n\"Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"It\\'s all right.\"\\n \\n\"I felt so terribly. I\\'ve been through such hell, Jake. Now everything\\'s\\ngone. Everything.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"so long. I\\'ve got to go.\"\\n \\nHe rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.\\n \\n\"So long, Jake,\" he said. \"You\\'ll shake hands, won\\'t you?\"\\n \\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\\n \\nWe shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well.\\n \\n\"Well,\" I said, \"see you in the morning.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m going away in the morning.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said.\\n \\nI went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room.\\n \\n\"Are you all right, Jake?\" he asked.\\n \\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said. \"I\\'m all right.\"\\n \\nI could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a\\ndeep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat\\ndown on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had\\ntaken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them\\ndown-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into\\nbed.\\n \\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n \\nI woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the\\nstreet. I remembered I had promised to take Bill\\'s friend Edna to see\\nthe bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went\\ndown-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing\\nthe square, hurrying toward the bull-ring. Across the square were the\\ntwo lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting\\nfor the tickets to go on sale at seven o\\'clock. I hurried across the\\nstreet to the café. The waiter told me that my friends had been there\\nand gone.\\n \\n\"How many were they?\"\\n \\n\"Two gentlemen and a lady.\"\\n \\nThat was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid\\nlast night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take\\nher. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the\\nbull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache.\\nEverything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early\\nmorning.\\n \\nThe stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was\\nmuddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and\\nthe outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with\\npeople. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in\\ntime to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the\\nfence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the\\ntwo fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They\\nwalked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come\\nrunning. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed\\nhim over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a\\ngreat shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the\\nboards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long\\nrunning pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then\\nanother drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He\\nwanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out,\\ncollared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the\\nfence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd\\nand the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the\\nbulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into\\nthe ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy,\\nmuddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running\\ncrowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man\\'s arms were by\\nhis sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted\\nhim and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front,\\nbut the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the\\ngate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the\\nring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were\\npressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.\\n \\nThe man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People\\nclimbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd\\nwas so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each\\nshout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the\\ndegree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was\\nhappening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the\\nbulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started\\nback toward the town.\\n \\nBack in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some\\nbuttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off\\nthe tables. One came over and took my order.\\n \\n\"Anything happen at the encierro?\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t see it all. One man was badly cogido.\"\\n \\n\"Where?\"\\n \\n\"Here.\" I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my\\nchest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The\\nwaiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his\\ncloth.\\n \\n\"Badly cogido,\" he said. \"All for sport. All for pleasure.\"\\n \\nHe went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots.\\nHe poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two\\nstreams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head.\\n \\n\"Badly cogido through the back,\" he said. He put the pots down on the\\ntable and sat down in the chair at the table. \"A big horn wound. All for\\nfun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s it. All for fun. Fun, you understand.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'re not an aficionado?\"\\n \\n\"Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals.\" He stood up and put his\\nhand on the small of his back. \"Right through the back. A cornada right\\nthrough the back. For fun--you understand.\"\\n \\nHe shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men\\nwere going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were\\ngrave-looking. One shook his head. \"Muerto!\" he called.\\n \\nThe waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some\\nerrand. The waiter came over to my table.\\n \\n\"You hear? Muerto. Dead. He\\'s dead. With a horn through him. All for\\nmorning fun. Es muy flamenco.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s bad.\"\\n \\n\"Not for me,\" the waiter said. \"No fun in that for me.\"\\n \\nLater in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named\\nVicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper\\nwe read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and\\ntwo children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he\\nwas married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the\\nbody, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin,\\nand the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the\\ndancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and\\nthere was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin\\nwalked the wife and two children.... Behind them marched all the\\nmembers of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella,\\nTafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin\\nwas loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two\\nchildren rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class\\nrailway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly,\\ngoing down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields\\nof grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.\\n \\nThe bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118\\nof the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by\\nPedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut\\nby popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it\\nto Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left\\nboth ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti\\ncigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that\\nstood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.\\n \\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n \\nBack in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the\\ndoor. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I\\ncame in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been\\nto the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I\\nfollowed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and\\nlay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the\\nsunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have\\nbeen half past three o\\'clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had\\nwaked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb\\nand fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time\\nhe was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved\\nhim. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one\\nknocked on the door.\\n \\n\"Come in.\"\\n \\nIt was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed.\\n \\n\"Some encierro,\" Bill said. \"Some encierro.\"\\n \\n\"I say, weren\\'t you there?\" Mike asked. \"Ring for some beer, Bill.\"\\n \\n\"What a morning!\" Bill said. He mopped off his face. \"My God! what a\\nmorning! And here\\'s old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag.\"\\n \\n\"What happened inside?\"\\n \\n\"Good God!\" Bill said, \"what happened, Mike?\"\\n \\n\"There were these bulls coming in,\" Mike said. \"Just ahead of them was\\nthe crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them\\ndown.\"\\n \\n\"And the bulls all came in right over them,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"I heard them yell.\"\\n \\n\"That was Edna,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts.\"\\n \\n\"One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over.\"\\n \\n\"They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"What a morning!\" Bill said. \"The damn police kept arresting chaps that\\nwanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls.\"\\n \\n\"The steers took them in, in the end,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"It took about an hour.\"\\n \\n\"It was really about a quarter of an hour,\" Mike objected.\\n \\n\"Oh, go to hell,\" Bill said. \"You\\'ve been in the war. It was two hours\\nand a half for me.\"\\n \\n\"Where\\'s that beer?\" Mike asked.\\n \\n\"What did you do with the lovely Edna?\"\\n \\n\"We took her home just now. She\\'s gone to bed.\"\\n \\n\"How did she like it?\"\\n \\n\"Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning.\"\\n \\n\"She was impressed,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"She wanted us to go down in the ring, too,\" Bill said. \"She likes\\naction.\"\\n \\n\"I said it wouldn\\'t be fair to my creditors,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"What a morning,\" Bill said. \"And what a night!\"\\n \\n\"How\\'s your jaw, Jake?\" Mike asked.\\n \\n\"Sore,\" I said.\\n \\nBill laughed.\\n \\n\"Why didn\\'t you hit him with a chair?\"\\n \\n\"You can talk,\" Mike said. \"He\\'d have knocked you out, too. I never saw\\nhim hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite\\nsuddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a\\ntable.\"\\n \\n\"Where did he go afterward?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"Here she is,\" Mike said. \"Here\\'s the beautiful lady with the beer.\"\\n \\nThe chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on\\nthe table.\\n \\n\"Now bring up three more bottles,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"Where did Cohn go after he hit me?\" I asked Bill.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t you know about that?\" Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured\\nthe beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.\\n \\n\"Really?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the\\nbull-fighter\\'s room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody\\nbull-fighter.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"What a night!\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to\\ntake Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine.\\nDamned touching scene.\"\\n \\nHe took a long drink of the beer.\\n \\n\"He is an ass.\"\\n \\n\"What happened?\"\\n \\n\"Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather\\ngood.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll bet she was,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the\\nbull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.\"\\n \\n\"I know. He shook hands with me.\"\\n \\n\"Did he? Well, they weren\\'t having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow\\nwas rather good. He didn\\'t say much, but he kept getting up and getting\\nknocked down again. Cohn couldn\\'t knock him out. It must have been\\ndamned funny.\"\\n \\n\"Where did you hear all this?\"\\n \\n\"Brett. I saw her this morning.\"\\n \\n\"What happened finally?\"\\n \\n\"It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He\\'d been\\nknocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more.\\nBrett held him and wouldn\\'t let him get up. He was weak, but Brett\\ncouldn\\'t hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn\\'t hit him\\nagain. Said he couldn\\'t do it. Said it would be wicked. So the\\nbull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back\\nagainst the wall.\\n \\n\"\\'So you won\\'t hit me?\\'\\n \\n\"\\'No,\\' said Cohn. \\'I\\'d be ashamed to.\\'\\n \\n\"So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the\\nface, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn\\'t get up, Brett said.\\nCohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn\\nhelped him he\\'d kill him, and he\\'d kill him anyway this morning if Cohn\\nwasn\\'t out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he\\nwanted to shake hands. I\\'ve told you that before.\"\\n \\n\"Tell the rest,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting\\nto get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn\\'t having\\nany shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved\\nher, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned\\ndown to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you\\nknow. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face\\nagain.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s quite a kid,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"He ruined Cohn,\" Mike said. \"You know I don\\'t think Cohn will ever want\\nto knock people about again.\"\\n \\n\"When did you see Brett?\"\\n \\n\"This morning. She came in to get some things. She\\'s looking after this\\nRomero lad.\"\\n \\nHe poured out another bottle of beer.\\n \\n\"Brett\\'s rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That\\'s how\\nwe came to go off together. She was looking after me.\"\\n \\n\"I know,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I\\'m rather drunk,\" Mike said. \"I think I\\'ll   rather drunk. This\\nis all awfully amusing, but it\\'s not too pleasant. It\\'s not too pleasant\\nfor me.\"\\n \\nHe drank off the beer.\\n \\n\"I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews\\nand bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble.\" He leaned\\nforward. \"I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours?\\nShe\\'ll bring you another one.\"\\n \\n\"Please,\" I said. \"I wasn\\'t drinking it, anyway.\"\\n \\nMike started to open the bottle. \"Would you mind opening it?\" I pressed\\nup the wire fastener and poured it for him.\\n \\n\"You know,\" Mike went on, \"Brett was rather good. She\\'s always rather\\ngood. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all\\nthose sort of people, and do you know what she said: \\'Yes. I\\'ve had such\\na hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!\\'\"\\n \\nHe took a drink.\\n \\n\"That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a\\nsailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn\\'t sleep in\\na bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really\\nbad, he used to tell her he\\'d kill her. Always slept with a loaded\\nservice revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he\\'d gone to\\nsleep. She hasn\\'t had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame,\\ntoo. She enjoys things so.\"\\n \\nHe stood up. His hand was shaky.\\n \\n\"I\\'m going in the room. Try and get a little sleep.\"\\n \\nHe smiled.\\n \\n\"We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I\\'m going to start now\\nand get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you\\nfrightfully nervy.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll see you at noon at the Iruña,\" Bill said.\\n \\nMike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.\\n \\nHe rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door.\\n \\n\"Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador,\" Mike\\ntold her.\\n \\n\"Si, Señorito.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m going to bed,\" Bill said. \"Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row\\nabout him last night.\"\\n \\n\"Where? At that Milano place?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of\\nCannes, once. He was damned nasty.\"\\n \\n\"I know the story.\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s what makes it bad.\"\\n \\n\"They oughtn\\'t to have any right. I wish to hell they didn\\'t have any\\nright. I\\'m going to bed.\"\\n \\n\"Was anybody killed in the ring?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t think so. Just badly hurt.\"\\n \\n\"A man was killed outside in the runway.\"\\n \\n\"Was there?\" said Bill.\\n \\nAt noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps\\nand drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big\\nmotor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking\\naround the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing\\ncars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it.\\nThey sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the\\nfiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the\\nfiesta.\\n \\nThe fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars\\nmade little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers\\nwere absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport\\nclothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in\\nblack smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you\\ndid not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there\\nwas music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were\\ngoing. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on\\neach other\\'s shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.\\n \\n\"Here comes Brett,\" Bill said.\\n \\nI looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking,\\nher head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and\\nshe found it pleasant and amusing.\\n \\n\"Hello, you chaps!\" she said. \"I say, I   a thirst.\"\\n \\n\"Get another big beer,\" Bill said to the waiter.\\n \\n\"Shrimps?\"\\n \\n\"Is Cohn gone?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" Bill said. \"He hired a car.\"\\n \\nThe beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook.\\nShe saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.\\n \\n\"Good beer.\"\\n \\n\"Very good,\" I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had\\nslept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be\\nunder control.\\n \\n\"I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"No. Knocked me out. That was all.\"\\n \\n\"I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero,\" Brett said. \"He hurt him most badly.\"\\n \\n\"How is he?\"\\n \\n\"He\\'ll be all right. He won\\'t go out of the room.\"\\n \\n\"Does he look badly?\"\\n \\n\"Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you\\nchaps for a minute.\"\\n \\n\"Is he going to fight?\"\\n \\n\"Rather. I\\'m going with you, if you don\\'t mind.\"\\n \\n\"How\\'s your boy friend?\" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything\\nthat Brett had said.\\n \\n\"Brett\\'s got a bull-fighter,\" he said. \"She had a Jew named Cohn, but he\\nturned out badly.\"\\n \\nBrett stood up.\\n \\n\"I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.\"\\n \\n\"How\\'s your boy friend?\"\\n \\n\"Damned well,\" Brett said. \"Watch him this afternoon.\"\\n \\n\"Brett\\'s got a bull-fighter,\" Mike said. \"A beautiful, bloody\\nbull-fighter.\"\\n \\n\"Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"Tell him all about your bull-fighter,\" Mike said. \"Oh, to hell with\\nyour bull-fighter!\" He tipped the table so that all the beers and the\\ndish of shrimps went over in a crash.\\n \\n\"Come on,\" Brett said. \"Let\\'s get out of this.\"\\n \\nIn the crowd crossing the square I said: \"How is it?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come\\nin and dress him. They\\'re very angry about me, he says.\"\\n \\nBrett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was\\nbright.\\n \\n\"I feel altogether changed,\" Brett said. \"You\\'ve no idea, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"Anything you want me to do?\"\\n \\n\"No, just go to the fight with me.\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll see you at lunch?\"\\n \\n\"No. I\\'m eating with him.\"\\n \\nWe were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were\\ncarrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.\\n \\n\"Want to take a turn out to the park?\" Brett asked. \"I don\\'t want to go\\nup yet. I fancy he\\'s sleeping.\"\\n \\nWe walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through\\nthe barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of\\nbooths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate.\\nWe could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed\\npeople. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t let\\'s go there,\" Brett said. \"I don\\'t want staring at just now.\"\\n \\nWe stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the\\nclouds from the sea.\\n \\n\"I hope the wind goes down,\" Brett said. \"It\\'s very bad for him.\"\\n \\n\"So do I.\"\\n \\n\"He says the bulls are all right.\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re good.\"\\n \\n\"Is that San Fermin\\'s?\"\\n \\nBrett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.\\n \\n\"Yes. Where the show started on Sunday.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go in. Do you mind? I\\'d rather like to pray a little for him or\\nsomething.\"\\n \\nWe went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It\\nwas dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes\\nadjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long\\nwooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw\\nshe was looking straight ahead.\\n \\n\"Come on,\" she whispered throatily. \"Let\\'s get out of here. Makes me\\ndamned nervous.\"\\n \\nOutside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the\\ntree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t know why I get so nervy in church,\" Brett said. \"Never does me\\nany good.\"\\n \\nWe walked along.\\n \\n\"I\\'m damned bad for a religious atmosphere,\" Brett said. \"I\\'ve the wrong\\ntype of face.\\n \\n\"You know,\" Brett said, \"I\\'m not worried about him at all. I just feel\\nhappy about him.\"\\n \\n\"Good.\"\\n \\n\"I wish the wind would drop, though.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s liable to go down by five o\\'clock.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s hope.\"\\n \\n\"You might pray,\" I laughed.\\n \\n\"Never does me any good. I\\'ve never gotten anything I prayed for. Have\\nyou?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, rot,\" said Brett. \"Maybe it works for some people, though. You\\ndon\\'t look very religious, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m pretty religious.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, rot,\" said Brett. \"Don\\'t start proselyting to-day. To-day\\'s going\\nto be bad enough as it is.\"\\n \\nIt was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way\\nsince before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the\\nhotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with\\npeople eating.\\n \\n\"Do look after Mike,\" Brett said. \"Don\\'t let him get too bad.\"\\n \\n\"Your frients haff gone up-stairs,\" the German maître d\\'hôtel said in\\nEnglish. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:\\n \\n\"Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?\"\\n \\n\"No,  .\"\\n \\n\"Good,\" said Brett.\\n \\n\"Save us a table for three,\" I said to the German. He smiled his dirty\\nlittle pink-and-white smile.\\n \\n\"Iss madam eating here?\"\\n \\n\"No,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t talk to him,\" Brett said. \"Mike must have been in bad shape,\" she\\nsaid on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did\\nnot smile.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll see you at the café,\" Brett said. \"Thank you, so much, Jake.\"\\n \\nWe had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down\\nthe hall and into Romero\\'s room. She did not knock. She simply opened\\nthe door, went in, and closed it behind her.\\n \\nI stood in front of the door of Mike\\'s room and knocked. There was no\\nanswer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great\\ndisorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There\\nwere empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a\\ndeath mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me.\\n \\n\"Hello, Jake,\" he said very slowly. \"I\\'m getting a lit tle sleep. I\\'ve\\nwant ed a lit tle sleep for a long time.\"\\n \\n\"Let me cover you over.\"\\n \\n\"No. I\\'m quite warm.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t go. I have n\\'t got ten to sleep yet.\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll sleep, Mike. Don\\'t worry, boy.\"\\n \\n\"Brett\\'s got a bull-fighter,\" Mike said. \"But her Jew has gone away.\"\\n \\nHe turned his head and looked at me.\\n \\n\"Damned good thing, what?\"\\n \\n\"Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m just start ing. I\\'m go ing to get a lit tle sleep.\"\\n \\nHe shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly.\\nBill was in my room reading the paper.\\n \\n\"See Mike?\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go and eat.\"\\n \\n\"I won\\'t eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned\\nsnotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.\"\\n \\n\"He was snotty to us, too.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go out and eat in the town.\"\\n \\nWe went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a\\ncovered tray.\\n \\n\"There goes Brett\\'s lunch,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"And the kid\\'s,\" I said.\\n \\nOutside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up.\\nHis red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.\\n \\n\"I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Go sit at it,\" Bill said. We went on out across the street.\\n \\nWe ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all\\nmen eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and\\nsinging. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much.\\nAfterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the\\nboiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked\\nin the room and that Mike was asleep.\\n \\nWhen the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the\\ncrowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us\\nwas the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of\\nthe barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front,\\nbeyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow.\\nIt looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and\\nfirm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the\\ncallejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting\\ncapes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and\\npacked in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather\\nsword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as\\nthe leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the\\ndark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to\\nspread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched\\nit all. She was absorbed in the professional details.\\n \\n\"He\\'s his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,\" she said. \"Why\\ndo they call them muletas?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n \\n\"I wonder if they ever launder them.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t think so. It might spoil the color.\"\\n \\n\"The blood must stiffen them,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"Funny,\" Brett said. \"How one doesn\\'t mind the blood.\"\\n \\nBelow in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged\\neverything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full.\\nThere was not an empty seat except in the President\\'s box. When he came\\nin the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway\\nthat led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms\\nfurled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in\\nacross the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.\\n \\n\"Here, would you like to look?\"\\n \\nI looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in\\nthe centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them\\nwere their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway\\nand in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was\\nwearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I\\ncould not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly\\nmarked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette\\nguardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan\\nand yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he\\nnor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were\\nall alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the\\ngrand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The\\nmusic started. Brett looked through the glasses.\\n \\n\"Here, take them,\" she said.\\n \\nThrough the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened\\nup and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads\\nback, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind\\nthem came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the\\ncapes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the\\npicadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains\\nof mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their\\nhats on, before the President\\'s box, and then came over to the barrera\\nbelow us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed\\nit over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the\\nsword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero\\'s lips were puffed, both\\neyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The\\nsword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and\\nhanded up the cape.\\n \\n\"Spread it out in front of you,\" I said.\\n \\nBrett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold.\\nThe sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man\\nbeside me leaned over toward Brett.\\n \\n\"He doesn\\'t want you to spread it,\" he said. \"You should fold it and\\nkeep it in your lap.\"\\n \\nBrett folded the heavy cape.\\n \\nRomero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had\\nsent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and\\nsmiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over\\nthe barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it\\nand Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then\\nscuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.\\n \\n\"What\\'s that for?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"To give it weight in the wind.\"\\n \\n\"His face looks bad,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"He feels very badly,\" Brett said. \"He should be in bed.\"\\n \\nThe first bull was Belmonte\\'s. Belmonte was very good. But because he\\ngot thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to\\nbuy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than\\nvery good. Belmonte\\'s great attraction is working close to the bull. In\\nbull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of\\nthe bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he\\nis comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull\\nhe is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the\\nterrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.\\nPeople went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic\\nsensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago\\nthey said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he\\nwas still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls.\\nWhen he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been,\\nand when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because\\nno real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to\\nhave done, not, of course, even Belmonte.\\n \\nAlso Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not\\nbe too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element\\nthat was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and\\nthe public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick\\nwith a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded\\nand cheated, and Belmonte\\'s jaw came further out in contempt, and his\\nface turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain\\nincreased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was\\nutterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great\\nafternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults,\\nand finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables,\\nthrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs.\\nHis jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that\\ntoothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something\\nparticularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced\\ngrew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment\\ncolor, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and\\ncushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same\\nwolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the\\nbarrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into\\nthe callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms,\\nnot seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he\\nlooked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a\\nlittle, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back\\ninto the ring.\\n \\nBecause they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the\\nmoment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him.\\nBelmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He\\npaid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all\\nabout. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it\\nwas a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with\\nMarcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he\\nknew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by\\nthe false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he\\nwould only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been\\nspoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully,\\nwhat he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The\\ncrowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American\\nambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not\\nenter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte\\nwas no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the\\nbull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things\\nwere not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of\\nthe old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he\\nhad discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for\\ntheir safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking\\nover at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had\\ntwo small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the\\ngreatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was\\nalways with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did\\nnot give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make\\nbull-fighting wonderful to him any more.\\n \\nPedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he\\nloved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he\\ncould control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon.\\nNever once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for\\nhimself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if\\nit pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him,\\nand yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss\\nto himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.\\n \\nHis first \"quite\" was directly below us. The three matadors take the\\nbull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the\\nfirst. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were\\nstanding at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his\\neyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in\\nthe spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the\\nhorse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he\\nwatched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel\\npoint of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head.\\nHe did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught\\nthe bull\\'s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not\\nthe flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the\\nhorse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of\\nmuscle on the bull\\'s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he\\npivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull\\'s\\nshoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.\\n \\nThe bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at\\nthe horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him\\nout with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped\\nand, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The\\nbull\\'s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of\\nthe bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape\\nswung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just\\nahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other\\nagain. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero\\'s cape filled\\nagain, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so\\nclose that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted\\nahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow\\nand so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep.\\nHe made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that\\nturned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand\\non his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going\\naway.\\n \\nIn his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After\\nthe first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the\\nvision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant\\nbull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the\\nbull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with\\na bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order\\nhim replaced.\\n \\n\"Why don\\'t they change him?\" Brett asked.\\n \\n\"They\\'ve paid for him. They don\\'t want to lose their money.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s hardly fair to Romero.\"\\n \\n\"Watch how he handles a bull that can\\'t see the color.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s the sort of thing I don\\'t like to see.\"\\n \\nIt was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was\\ndoing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or\\nthe scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent\\nwith his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and\\nwould start for it, and then shift the bull\\'s charge to the flannel and\\nfinish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not\\nlike it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that\\nlittle sidestep each time as he transferred the bull\\'s charge from his\\nown body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte\\'s imitation of himself\\nor Marcial\\'s imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row\\nbehind us.\\n \\n\"What\\'s he afraid of the bull for? The bull\\'s so dumb he only goes after\\nthe cloth.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s just a young bull-fighter. He hasn\\'t learned it yet.\"\\n \\n\"But I thought he was fine with the cape before.\"\\n \\n\"Probably he\\'s nervous now.\"\\n \\nOut in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the\\nsame thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly,\\noffering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching\\ndully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again\\nand finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came,\\ngiving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost\\nimperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the\\nBiarritz bull-fight experts.\\n \\n\"He\\'s going to kill now,\" I said to Brett. \"The bull\\'s still strong. He\\nwouldn\\'t wear himself out.\"\\n \\nOut in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew\\nthe sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and\\nsighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero\\'s\\nleft hand dropped the muleta over the bull\\'s muzzle to blind him, his\\nleft shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and\\nfor just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the\\nbull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had\\ngone in between the bull\\'s shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There\\nwas a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one\\nhand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve,\\nthe white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight\\nbetween his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.\\n \\n\"There he goes,\" Bill said.\\n \\nRomero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he\\nspoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward\\nand he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.\\n \\nThey handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta\\nin his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President\\'s box,\\nbowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the\\nsword and muleta.\\n \\n\"Bad one,\" said the sword-handler.\\n \\n\"He made me sweat,\" said Romero. He wiped off his face. The\\nsword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt\\nhim to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.\\n \\nMarcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero\\'s last\\nbull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man\\nin the morning running.\\n \\nDuring Romero\\'s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable.\\nEverything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly\\ndelicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.\\nThe fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been\\nsmashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing\\nthat he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a\\ngood bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged\\neasily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.\\n \\nWhen he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the\\ncrowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did\\nnot want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in\\nbull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow,\\ntempled and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There\\nwas no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a\\nsudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.\\n \\nThe bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed\\ndirectly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last\\nbull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull,\\ndrew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the\\nblade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of\\nhis feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta\\nheld low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a\\nstep forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between\\nthe shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that\\ndisappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The\\nbull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from\\nside to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero\\'s older\\nbrother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the\\nbull\\'s neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove\\nthe knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid.\\nRomero\\'s brother, holding the bull\\'s horn in one hand, the knife in the\\nother, looked up at the President\\'s box. Handkerchiefs were waving all\\nover the bull-ring. The President looked down from the box and waved his\\nhandkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull\\nand trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the\\nsand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the\\narena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance\\naround the bull.\\n \\nRomero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the\\nPresident. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the\\ncrowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear\\nto Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him.\\nBrett held down the cape.\\n \\n\"You liked it?\" Romero called.\\n \\nBrett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett\\nhad the ear in her hand.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t get bloody,\" Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him.\\nSeveral boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and\\nthe drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were\\nall around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He\\nfought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them,\\ntoward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people\\'s shoulders.\\nBut they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were\\nspraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all\\nrunning toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody\\'s shoulder. He\\nlooked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the\\ngate with him.\\n \\nWe all three went back to the hotel. Brett went up-stairs. Bill and I\\nsat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and\\ndrank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes\\nwith his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate.\\nBelmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o\\'clock train\\nfor Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and\\nate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk.\\nHe only answered questions.\\n \\nBill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight\\nvery hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people\\nat his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.\\n \\n\"Come on over to the café,\" Bill said. \"I want an absinthe.\"\\n \\nIt was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy\\nagain. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were\\nmaking up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with\\nbeech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with\\nlong bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music\\nand the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.\\n \\n\"Where\\'s Edna?\" I asked Bill.\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n \\nWe watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta.\\nThe absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in\\nthe dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.\\n \\n\"I feel sorry about Cohn,\" Bill said. \"He had an awful time.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, to hell with Cohn,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Where do you suppose he went?\"\\n \\n\"Up to Paris.\"\\n \\n\"What do you suppose he\\'ll do?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, to hell with him.\"\\n \\n\"What do you suppose he\\'ll do?\"\\n \\n\"Pick up with his old girl, probably.\"\\n \\n\"Who was his old girl?\"\\n \\n\"Somebody named Frances.\"\\n \\nWe had another absinthe.\\n \\n\"When do you go back?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"To-morrow.\"\\n \\nAfter a little while Bill said: \"Well, it was a swell fiesta.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"something doing all the time.\"\\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t believe it. It\\'s like a wonderful nightmare.\"\\n \\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"I\\'d believe anything. Including nightmares.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter? Feel low?\"\\n \\n\"Low as hell.\"\\n \\n\"Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor.\"\\n \\n\"I feel like hell,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Drink that,\" said Bill. \"Drink it slow.\"\\n \\nIt was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel\\ndrunk but I did not feel any better.\\n \\n\"How do you feel?\"\\n \\n\"I feel like hell.\"\\n \\n\"Have another?\"\\n \\n\"It won\\'t do any good.\"\\n \\n\"Try it. You can\\'t tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey,\\nwaiter! Another absinthe for this señor!\"\\n \\nI poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it\\ndrip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon\\nin the brownish, cloudy mixture.\\n \\n\"How is it?\"\\n \\n\"Fine.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t drink it fast that way. It will make you sick.\"\\n \\nI set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.\\n \\n\"I feel tight.\"\\n \\n\"You ought to.\"\\n \\n\"That\\'s what you wanted, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n \\n\"Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.\"\\n \\n\"Well, I\\'m tight. Is that what you want?\"\\n \\n\"Sit down.\"\\n \\n\"I won\\'t sit down,\" I said. \"I\\'m going over to the hotel.\"\\n \\nI was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At\\nthe hotel I went up-stairs. Brett\\'s door was open. I put my head in the\\nroom. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.\\n \\n\"Jake,\" he said. \"Come in, Jake.\"\\n \\nI went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some\\nfixed point.\\n \\n\"Brett, you know. She\\'s gone off with the bull-fighter chap.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o\\'clock\\ntrain.\"\\n \\n\"Did they?\"\\n \\n\"Bad thing to do,\" Mike said. \"She shouldn\\'t have done it.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m drunk,\" I said. \"I\\'m going in and lie down.\"\\n \\n\"Are you blind? I was blind myself.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I\\'m blind.\"\\n \\n\"Well, bung-o,\" Mike said. \"Get some sleep, old Jake.\"\\n \\nI went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed\\nwent sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it\\nstop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean\\nanything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with\\nthem. I pretended to be asleep.\\n \\n\"He\\'s asleep. Better let him alone.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s blind as a tick,\" Mike said. They went out.\\n \\nI got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the\\nsquare. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and\\nbright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I\\nlooked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the\\ndining-room.\\n \\n\"Here he is!\" said Bill. \"Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn\\'t pass out.\"\\n \\n\"Hello, you old drunk,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"I got hungry and woke up.\"\\n \\n\"Eat some soup,\" Bill said.\\n \\nThe three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six\\npeople were missing.\\n \\nIn the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about\\nnine o\\'clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was\\nempty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were\\npicking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafés were just opening and\\nthe waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and\\narranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the\\narcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.\\n \\nI sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The\\nwaiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the\\nunloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were\\nstill up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron\\ncame out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down\\nthe notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing\\naway the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.\\n \\nI drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come\\nwalking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a\\ncoffee.\\n \\n\"Well,\" he said, \"it\\'s all over.\"\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"When do you go?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. We better get a car, I think. Aren\\'t you going back to\\nParis?\"\\n \\n\"No. I can stay away another week. I think I\\'ll go to San Sebastian.\"\\n \\n\"I want to get back.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s Mike going to do?\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s going to Saint Jean de Luz.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up\\nfrom there to-night.\"\\n \\n\"Good. Let\\'s go after lunch.\"\\n \\n\"All right. I\\'ll get the car.\"\\n \\nWe had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the\\nmaids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and\\nstrapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the\\nfront seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through\\nthe side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from\\nPamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of\\nFundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and\\nout of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet,\\ngreen, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill\\'s baggage\\nat the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at\\nseven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in\\nfront.\\n \\n\"What shall we do about the car?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"Oh, bother the car,\" Mike said. \"Let\\'s just keep the car with us.\"\\n \\n\"All right,\" Bill said. \"Where shall we go?\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s go to Biarritz and have a drink.\"\\n \\n\"Old Mike the spender,\" Bill said.\\n \\nWe drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We\\nwent into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.\\n \\n\"That drink\\'s mine,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"Let\\'s roll for it.\"\\n \\nSo we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out\\nfirst roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc\\nnote. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and\\nMike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room\\noff the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar.\\nWe had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill\\nand Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the\\nsecond. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He\\nhanded the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there\\nwere three kings, an ace, and a queen.\\n \\n\"It\\'s yours, Mike,\" Bill said. \"Old Mike, the gambler.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m so sorry,\" Mike said. \"I can\\'t get it.\"\\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ve no money,\" Mike said. \"I\\'m stony. I\\'ve just twenty francs. Here,\\ntake twenty francs.\"\\n \\nBill\\'s face sort of changed.\\n \\n\"I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll cash you a check,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"That\\'s damned nice of you, but you see I can\\'t write checks.\"\\n \\n\"What are you going to do for money?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, some will come through. I\\'ve two weeks allowance should be here. I\\ncan live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean.\"\\n \\n\"What do you want to do about the car?\" Bill asked me. \"Do you want to\\nkeep it on?\"\\n \\n\"It doesn\\'t make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic.\"\\n \\n\"Come on, let\\'s have another drink,\" Mike said.\\n \\n\"Fine. This one is on me,\" Bill said. \"Has Brett any money?\" He turned\\nto Mike.\\n \\n\"I shouldn\\'t think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.\"\\n \\n\"She hasn\\'t any money with her?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"I shouldn\\'t think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred\\nquid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.\"\\n \\n\"I suppose they get it at the source,\" said Bill.\\n \\n\"Quite. They\\'re not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They\\'re\\nScotsmen, I believe.\"\\n \\n\"Hasn\\'t she any at all with her?\" I asked.\\n \\n\"I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left.\"\\n \\n\"Well,\" Bill said, \"we might as well have another drink.\"\\n \\n\"Damned good idea,\" Mike said. \"One never gets anywhere by discussing\\nfinances.\"\\n \\n\"No,\" said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost\\nand paid. We went out to the car.\\n \\n\"Anywhere you\\'d like to go, Mike?\" Bill asked.\\n \\n\"Let\\'s take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let\\'s drive about a\\nlittle.\"\\n \\n\"Fine. I\\'d like to see the coast. Let\\'s drive down toward Hendaye.\"\\n \\n\"I haven\\'t any credit along the coast.\"\\n \\n\"You can\\'t ever tell,\" said Bill.\\n \\nWe drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands,\\nthe white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue\\nwith the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We\\ndrove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down\\nthe coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the\\nmountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill\\nlooked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the\\nglass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out\\ninto the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch\\nof meadow, then the sea.\\n \\nAt the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the\\ncar and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the\\nside of the car.\\n \\n\"Good-bye, you chaps,\" Mike said. \"It was a damned fine fiesta.\"\\n \\n\"So long, Mike,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll see you around,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t worry about money,\" Mike said. \"You can pay for the car, Jake,\\nand I\\'ll send you my share.\"\\n \\n\"So long, Mike.\"\\n \\n\"So long, you chaps. You\\'ve been damned nice.\"\\n \\nWe all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road\\nwatching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried\\nBill\\'s bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the\\ntracks.\\n \\n\"So long, fella,\" Bill said.\\n \\n\"So long, kid!\"\\n \\n\"It was swell. I\\'ve had a swell time.\"\\n \\n\"Will you be in Paris?\"\\n \\n\"No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!\"\\n \\n\"So long, old kid!\"\\n \\nHe went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the\\nbags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The\\nwindow passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty.\\nI went outside to the car.\\n \\n\"How much do we owe you?\" I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had\\nbeen fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.\\n \\n\"Two hundred pesetas.\"\\n \\n\"How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way\\nback?\"\\n \\n\"Fifty pesetas.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t kid me.\"\\n \\n\"Thirty-five pesetas.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s not worth it,\" I said. \"Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri.\"\\n \\nAt the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered\\nwith dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last\\nthing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the\\ncar in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the\\nroad to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the\\nsame room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That\\nseemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in\\nthe town.\\n \\nAt a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York   and sat\\nin a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a\\nsafe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill,\\nexcept that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with\\nfiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does\\nnot open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and\\nswim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the\\npromenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with\\ntheir nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be\\nband concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit\\nin the Marinas and listen.\\n \\n\"How does one eat inside?\" I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a\\nrestaurant.\\n \\n\"Well. Very well. One eats very well.\"\\n \\n\"Good.\"\\n \\nI went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed\\nvery carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for\\ncompany. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly\\nand to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine\\nwas good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a\\nBasque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a\\nliqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the\\nPyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil\\nand smelled like Italian  . I told him to take the flowers of the\\nPyrenees away and bring me a  . The   was good. I had a\\nsecond   after the coffee.\\n \\nThe waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees,\\nso I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a\\ncountry where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell\\nwhether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear\\nfinancial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one\\nmakes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason.\\nIf you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I\\nspent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable\\nqualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again\\nsome time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his\\ntable. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis.\\nI was back in France.\\n \\nNext morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make\\nmore friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the\\nstation I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not\\nthink I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French\\nfriends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there\\nagain. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be\\nloyal.\\n \\nAt Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave\\nFrance. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going\\nback into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like\\na fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport,\\nopened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate,\\nclimbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was\\nat San Sebastian.\\n \\nEven on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The\\ntrees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel\\nas though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on\\ncertain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where\\nI had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened\\nout above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond\\nthe roofs.\\n \\nI unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of\\nthe bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big\\narmoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in\\nthe bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to\\nsummer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an\\nhour by coming to San Sebastian.\\n \\nAs I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police\\nbulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms,\\nand wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all\\nmail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I\\nwould be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking\\nthem to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six\\ndays. Then I went in and had lunch.\\n \\nAfter lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When\\nI woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with\\na comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the\\nConcha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm,\\nand the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my\\nsuit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm\\nunder bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the\\nbeach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form\\nthe harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although\\nthe tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like\\nundulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke\\nsmoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller\\ncame I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the\\nchill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot\\nplanks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the\\ntop strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay\\nface downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he\\nsaid, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun\\nuntil I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming\\ndown to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark.\\nThe raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled\\nup, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay\\non the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off\\nmy suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.\\n \\nI walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up\\none of the cool streets to the Café Marinas. There was an orchestra\\nplaying inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the\\nfresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved\\nice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for\\na long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.\\n \\nLater when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out\\nalong the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was\\na bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping\\nthat night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was\\na long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers.\\nThey were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their\\nmeal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were\\ntwo good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre\\nchic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in\\nslang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes\\nat the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them.\\nThe next morning at five o\\'clock the race resumed with the last lap, San\\nSebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned\\nand browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except\\namong themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did\\nnot make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The\\nmoney could be arranged.\\n \\nThe man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack\\nof boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His\\nneck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders\\njoked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork.\\n \\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars\\nthat the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.\"\\n \\nOne of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned\\nred. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.\\n \\nI had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big\\nbicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and\\nwould have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at\\nPamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than\\nin France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said.\\nHad I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de\\nFrance was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and\\norganizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know\\nFrance. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with\\nbicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed\\nthe riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and\\nmore   every year. It would be the most   country in the\\nworld. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew\\nFrance.   He knew road-racing. We had a cognac.\\nAfter all, though, it wasn\\'t bad to get back to Paris. There is only one\\nPaname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most  \\nin the world. Did I know the  ? Did I not. I would see\\nhim there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another  \\ntogether. We certainly would. They started at six o\\'clock less a quarter\\nin the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to.\\nWould I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a\\ncall at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take\\nthe trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until\\nthe next morning.\\n \\nIn the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars\\nhad been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed\\nand then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything\\nwas fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and\\nin peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish\\nchildren were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree\\ntalking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and\\nthere was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.\\n \\nI undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach\\nand went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers,\\nbut having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and\\nfloated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the\\nswells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big\\nroller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have\\na wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I\\nturned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt\\nas though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long\\nswim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat,\\ndripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked\\naround at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the\\npromenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered\\nnames. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill\\nwith a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the\\nother side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high\\nheadland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid\\nof cramp.\\n \\nI sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very\\nsmall. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the\\nraft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come\\nup through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and\\nswam slowly and steadily in to shore.\\n \\nAfter I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to\\nthe hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of  \\naround, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and\\nsat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French\\nsporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a\\nblue envelope in his hand.\\n \\n\"A telegram for you, sir.\"\\n \\nI poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it\\nopen, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris:\\n \\nI tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming\\nalong the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and\\nlooked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was\\njust behind him.\\n \\n\"Here\\'s another telegram for you, sir.\"\\n \\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\\n \\nI opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.\\n \\nThe concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably.\\n \\n\"What time is there a train for Madrid?\"\\n \\n\"It left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the\\nSud Express at ten to-night.\"\\n \\n\"Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?\"\\n \\n\"Just as you wish,\" he said. \"I will have it put on the bill.\"\\n \\n\"Do that.\"\\n \\nWell, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I\\nhad expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the\\ndoorway.\\n \\n\"Bring me a telegram form, please.\"\\n \\nHe brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:\\n \\nThat seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man.\\nIntroduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back.\\nAnd sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch.\\n \\nI did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had\\nbreakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country\\nbetween Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray\\nand long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw\\nMadrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a\\nlittle cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.\\n \\nThe Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish\\nthere. They don\\'t go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line\\nof hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we\\nclimbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished\\nchurch on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high,\\nhot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta\\ndel Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San\\nJeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The\\nwindows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped\\nat the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The\\ntaxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could\\nnot make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a\\ncut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I\\nrang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.\\n \\n\"Is Lady Ashley here?\" I asked.\\n \\nShe looked at me dully.\\n \\n\"Is an Englishwoman here?\"\\n \\nShe turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the\\ndoor. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face.\\nShe was short and commanding.\\n \\n\"Muy buenos,\" I said. \"Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to\\nsee this English lady.\"\\n \\n\"Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her\\nif she wishes to see you.\"\\n \\n\"She wishes to see me.\"\\n \\n\"The chica will ask her.\"\\n \\n\"It is very hot.\"\\n \\n\"It is very hot in the summer in Madrid.\"\\n \\n\"And how cold in winter.\"\\n \\n\"Yes, it is very cold in winter.\"\\n \\nDid I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana?\\n \\nOf that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags\\nwere brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be\\nstolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas,\\nyes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly\\nselectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the\\nupbringal of my bags.\\n \\nThe maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male\\nEnglish now, at once.\\n \\n\"Good,\" I said. \"You see. It is as I said.\"\\n \\n\"Clearly.\"\\n \\nI followed the maid\\'s back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she\\nknocked on a door.\\n \\n\"Hello,\" said Brett. \"Is it you, Jake?\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s me.\"\\n \\n\"Come in. Come in.\"\\n \\nI opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She\\nhad just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room\\nwas in that disorder produced only by those who have always had\\nservants.\\n \\n\"Darling!\" Brett said.\\n \\nI went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and\\nwhile she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She\\nwas trembling in my arms. She felt very small.\\n \\n\"Darling! I\\'ve had such a hell of a time.\"\\n \\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n \\n\"Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go.\"\\n \\n\"Why didn\\'t you keep him?\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. It isn\\'t the sort of thing one does. I don\\'t think I hurt\\nhim any.\"\\n \\n\"You were probably damn good for him.\"\\n \\n\"He shouldn\\'t be living with any one. I realized that right away.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, hell!\" she said, \"let\\'s not talk about it. Let\\'s never talk about\\nit.\"\\n \\n\"All right.\"\\n \\n\"It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for\\na while, you know.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the café, I guess. He wanted me to\\ngrow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I\\'d look so like hell.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s funny.\"\\n \\n\"He said it would make me more womanly. I\\'d look a fright.\"\\n \\n\"What happened?\"\\n \\n\"Oh, he got over that. He wasn\\'t ashamed of me long.\"\\n \\n\"What was it about being in trouble?\"\\n \\n\"I didn\\'t know whether I could make him go, and I didn\\'t have a sou to\\ngo away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I\\ntold him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn\\'t take his\\nmoney, you know.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, let\\'s not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do\\ngive me a cigarette.\"\\n \\nI lit the cigarette.\\n \\n\"He learned his English as a waiter in Gib.\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"He wanted to marry me, finally.\"\\n \\n\"Really?\"\\n \\n\"Of course. I can\\'t even marry Mike.\"\\n \\n\"Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley.\"\\n \\n\"No. It wasn\\'t that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn\\'t go away\\nfrom him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from\\nhim. After I\\'d gotten more womanly, of course.\"\\n \\n\"You ought to feel set up.\"\\n \\n\"I do. I\\'m all right again. He\\'s wiped out that damned Cohn.\"\\n \\n\"Good.\"\\n \\n\"You know I\\'d have lived with him if I hadn\\'t seen it was bad for him.\\nWe got along damned well.\"\\n \\n\"Outside of your personal appearance.\"\\n \\n\"Oh, he\\'d have gotten used to that.\"\\n \\nShe put out the cigarette.\\n \\n\"I\\'m thirty-four, you know. I\\'m not going to be one of these bitches\\nthat ruins children.\"\\n \\n\"No.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel\\nrather set up.\"\\n \\n\"Good.\"\\n \\nShe looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I\\nsaw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She\\nwouldn\\'t look up. I put my arms around her.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t let\\'s ever talk about it. Please don\\'t let\\'s ever talk about it.\"\\n \\n\"Dear Brett.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m going back to Mike.\" I could feel her crying as I held her close.\\n\"He\\'s so damned nice and he\\'s so awful. He\\'s my sort of thing.\"\\n \\nShe would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking.\\n \\n\"I won\\'t be one of those bitches,\" she said. \"But, oh, Jake, please\\nlet\\'s never talk about it.\"\\n \\nWe left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me\\npay the bill. The bill had been paid.\\n \\n\"Oh, well. Let it go,\" Brett said. \"It doesn\\'t matter now.\"\\n \\nWe rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for\\nberths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the\\nhotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman\\nshook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker.\\n \\n\"It\\'s funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big\\nhotel,\" I said.\\n \\n\"Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more.\"\\n \\n\"No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s odd.\"\\n \\n\"Bartenders have always been fine.\"\\n \\n\"You know,\" Brett said, \"it\\'s quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn\\'t it\\namazing?\"\\n \\nWe touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They\\nwere coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of\\nMadrid.\\n \\n\"I like an olive in a Martini,\" I said to the barman.\\n \\n\"Right you are, sir. There you are.\"\\n \\n\"Thanks.\"\\n \\n\"I should have asked, you know.\"\\n \\nThe barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our\\nconversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the\\nwood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after\\nthat first sip.\\n \\n\"It\\'s good. Isn\\'t it a nice bar?\"\\n \\n\"They\\'re all nice bars.\"\\n \\n\"You know I didn\\'t believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in\\nschool in Paris, then. Think of that.\"\\n \\n\"Anything you want me to think about it?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t be an ass.   you buy a lady a drink?\"\\n \\n\"We\\'ll have two more Martinis.\"\\n \\n\"As they were before, sir?\"\\n \\n\"They were very good.\" Brett smiled at him.\\n \\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\n \\n\"Well, bung-o,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Bung-o!\"\\n \\n\"You know,\" Brett said, \"he\\'d only been with two women before. He never\\ncared about anything but bull-fighting.\"\\n \\n\"He\\'s got plenty of time.\"\\n \\n\"I don\\'t know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.\"\\n \\n\"Well, it was you.\"\\n \\n\"Yes. It was me.\"\\n \\n\"I thought you weren\\'t going to ever talk about it.\"\\n \\n\"How can I help it?\"\\n \\n\"You\\'ll lose it if you talk about it.\"\\n \\n\"I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.\"\\n \\n\"You should.\"\\n \\n\"You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.\"\\n \\n\"Yes.\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s sort of what we have instead of God.\"\\n \\n\"Some people have God,\" I said. \"Quite a lot.\"\\n \\n\"He never worked very well with me.\"\\n \\n\"Should we have another Martini?\"\\n \\nThe barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh\\nglasses.\\n \\n\"Where will we have lunch?\" I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could\\nfeel the heat outside through the window.\\n \\n\"Here?\" asked Brett.\\n \\n\"It\\'s rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin\\'s?\" I\\nasked the barman.\\n \\n\"Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?\"\\n \\n\"Thank you.\"\\n \\nWe lunched up-stairs at Botin\\'s. It is one of the best restaurants in\\nthe world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank  .\\nBrett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and\\ndrank three bottles of  .\\n \\n\"How do you feel, Jake?\" Brett asked. \"My God! what a meal you\\'ve\\neaten.\"\\n \\n\"I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?\"\\n \\n\"Lord, no.\"\\n \\nBrett was smoking.\\n \\n\"You like to eat, don\\'t you?\" she said.\\n \\n\"Yes.\" I said. \"I like to do a lot of things.\"\\n \\n\"What do you like to do?\"\\n \\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"I like to do a lot of things. Don\\'t you want a dessert?\"\\n \\n\"You asked me that once,\" Brett said.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"So I did. Let\\'s have another bottle of  .\"\\n \\n\"It\\'s very good.\"\\n \\n\"You haven\\'t drunk much of it,\" I said.\\n \\n\"I have. You haven\\'t seen.\"\\n \\n\"Let\\'s get two bottles,\" I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in\\nmy glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched\\nglasses.\\n \\n\"Bung-o!\" Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put\\nher hand on my arm.\\n \\n\"Don\\'t get drunk, Jake,\" she said. \"You don\\'t have to.\"\\n \\n\"How do you know?\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t,\" she said. \"You\\'ll be all right.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'m not getting drunk,\" I said. \"I\\'m just drinking a little wine. I\\nlike to drink wine.\"\\n \\n\"Don\\'t get drunk,\" she said. \"Jake, don\\'t get drunk.\"\\n \\n\"Want to go for a ride?\" I said. \"Want to ride through the town?\"\\n \\n\"Right,\" Brett said. \"I haven\\'t seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.\"\\n \\n\"I\\'ll finish this,\" I said.\\n \\nDown-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the\\nstreet. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street\\nwas a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked.\\nA taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped\\nhim and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The\\ndriver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me.\\nWe sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested\\nagainst me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses\\nlooked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.\\n \\n\"Oh, Jake,\" Brett said, \"we could have had such a damned good time\\ntogether.\"\\n \\nAhead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his\\nbaton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.\\n \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Isn\\'t it pretty to think so?\"\\n '"
